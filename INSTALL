                      Sqsh - Installation Notes

Description
-=-=-=-=-=-

The follow document describes how to build and install the Sqsh SQL
shell, version 2.1.6. For an overall description of the package, please
refer to the file README.

Supported Platforms
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This program has been built and tested (although by no means would I
say thoroughly) on a whole slew of platforms, including Solaris 2.x,
SunOS 4.x, HP-UX 10.x, HP-UX 11.x, IRIX 5.x, IRIX 6.x, NCR SVR4,
Dynix/ptx 2.x, NeXT, AIX 3.x, AIX 4.x, Digital UNIX 3.x, DG/UX 5.4.x,
Linux 2.x, and NetBSD (I am sure that there are more).
This package also builds in the Cygwin environment under Windows,
see the cygwin directory for details.

Requirements
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In order to build this package, you will need:

   o  Sybase CT-Library

      You'll need a full installation of Open Client 11.x or greater
      to compile against (you only need the run-time to run sqsh 
      however).  Sqsh may still compile against Open Client 10.x,
      however that release is *very* old and I don't have a copy
      around to test with any more.

      Note: If you have a 64 bit installation of ASE then you will
      normally only have the 64bit version of Client Library. This means
      that you either need to install the 32bit version of the SDK
      (available from sybase.subscribenet.com), or you need to build
      sqsh in 64 bit mode. This is NOT yet handled automatically - you
      will need to add the proper flags for your C compiler to generate
      64 bit code, and you will need to add -DSYB_LP64 to the CFLAGS
      macro in src/Makefile. Note that any libraries that you want to 
      link with (for example "readline" must also have the 64bit
      objects - you can't link 32 bir and 64 bit code in the same 
      binary).

   o  FreeTDS

      If you don't have CT-Library, or you want to connect to a 
      Microsoft SQL Server (7.0 or 2000), sqsh should now, 
      out-of-the-box, compile and run against FreeTDS (I've
      tested personally with 0.52 and the current CVS tree).
      You can get FreeTDS from http://www.freetds.org/.

      PLEASE: Unfortunately, I don't have much spare time available
      these days, so if you are having problems (core dumps,
      connectivity, etc.) when using FreeTDS, please try posting
      to the FreeTDS mailing list before proclaiming it a sqsh
      issue.  ALSO, note that FreeTDS does not currently support
      all of features of Open Client, so many of the flags that
      sqsh supports (such as locale and charset changes) will
      not work.

   o  X11R4 or Later (optional)

      To take advantage of the X Windowing System display style, you 
      must have at least X11R4 (R5 or later recommended).  This may 
      be found from ftp://ftp.x.org.

   o  GNU Readline library (optional)

      If you want emacs/vi style keyboard editing, this package is a must.
      I'll warn you though, it'll add some major bulk to the executable.
      You can get it from 

         http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html
      
      Sqsh should work with versions of readline as old as 2.2,
      but is currently being tested with version 4.2.

Problems
-=-=-=-=-

If you have any trouble while trying to build sqsh, first make sure
that you read the FAQ supplied with the distribution.

Building
-=-=-=-=-

Sqsh takes advantage of the GNU auto-configuration package (a truly
nifty tool) so it should be relatively easy to make and build. 
Just follow the following directions:

1) Set $SYBASE

   In order for auto-configuration to work correctly, the environment
   variable SYBASE must be correctly set to point to your base SYBASE
   directory.  For bourne shell users (sh, bash, zsh, etc.), simply
   do:

      % SYBASE=/usr/local/sybase
      % export SYBASE
   
   or for csh and that ilk, do:

      % setenv SYBASE /usr/local/sybase

   If you are using Sybase 12.0 or later, the simplest thing to do is
   to "source" the SYBASE.sh or SYBASE.csh file located in the 
   Sybase installation root directory - this will set all of the 
   necessary environment variables.

2) Run "configure"

   $ ./configure

   The configure shell script goes out and attempts to figure out
   exactly what your machine looks like.  The script supports the
   following options:

       --prefix=DIR

         Specifies an alternate base directory in which to install
         the sqsh binary and man page (in DIR/{man,bin}). By default
         this is /usr/local.

      --exec_prefix=DIR

         This option allows the binary to be installed in a directory
         other than the one specified with --prefix, instead the
         binary will be placed in DIR/bin.
      
      --with-readline

         If you have the GNU Readline library available (see Requirements,
         above), supply this flag to enable readline support in sqsh. 
         Supplying this option will cause 'configure' to attempt to
         automatically determine the location of your readline header
         files and libraries.  Hints may be supplied as to the location
         of these files using the INCDIRS and LIBDIRS environment
         variables described below, otherwise a search-path of common
         installation locations are used instead.

      --with-x

         Enables X windows support in sqsh.  This requires the existence
         of X11R4 or later on your system.  By default, if this flag
         is not supplied, X support is disabled.

      --without-x

         Disables X support.  This is the same as running configure
         without '-with-x'.
      
      --x-includes=<incdir>
      
         By default, if --with-x is supplied configure will auto-
         matically attempt to find the location of your X11 
         include directory.  If it fails or chooses the wrong
         directory, this option may be supplied to force it to
         use <incdir>.
   
      --x-libraries=<libdir>

         As with --x-includes, this will override configures attempts
         to automatically determine the location of your X11 libraries.
      
      --with-motif[=<path>]

         Causes the X support for sqsh to use Motif widgets rather than
         the default (and rather crude) Athena widget set.  Enabling
         this option also automatically enables --with-x. If <path>
         is supplied, then <path>/include/X11 will be used to find the
         Motif include headers, and <path>/lib will be chosen to find
         Motif libraries.

      --with-static

         Forces sqsh to be compiled by statically linking in the
         appropriate Open Client libraries rather than dynamically
         linking with them.  Note that all other libraries continue
         to be dynamically linked.

      --with-gcc

         Forces configure to chose gcc as the compiler of choice
         regardless of whether or not a different C compiler is
         found earlier in your path.
      
   Also, the following environment variables may be set prior to
   running 'configure' to alter its behavior:

      CC 
         Forces configure to use the value of $CC as the default
         C compiler.  This variable may also specify flags to pass
         to the compiler, such as "cc -O -Wall".

      INCDIRS
         When attempting to discover the location of the readline
         header files (only when --with-readline is specified), this
         variable may supply a colon separated set of directories
         in which to look for the header files, rather than the
         default search path.

      LIBDIRS
         As with INCDIRS, this variable is used to track down the
         location of the readline library.

   When configure has finished it should have generated Makefile,
   and config.h.

3) OPTIONAL: Edit the file 'src/Makefile' and read through the settings
   that 'configure' chose. There are a couple of options (such as
   additional built-in debugging) that can only be enabled by editing
   the Makefile; it is pretty well commented.

4) OPTIONAL: Browse through 'src/config.h'.  This file is generated by 
   configure as it makes guesses about the configuration of your systems,
   and will probably not have to be touched.  If you don't understand
   the meaning of a define, you should probably leave it alone.

5) OPTIONAL: Browse through 'sqsh_config.h', you probably won't have 
   to change many of these values, they are simply default values for 
   various items, such as temporary directories, etc.

6) Now, attempt to build it:

   $ make

   This will (hopefully) create the sqsh executable.

7) Now, try to install it:

   $ make install

   This will install the binary into ${prefix}/bin, or ${exec_prefix}/bin,
   if --exec_prefix was specified. It will also make a copy of 
   doc/global.sqshrc called ${prefix}/etc/sqshrc.

   Optionally, you may also execute:

   $ make install-wrapper

   This will install sqsh as ${prefix}/bin/sqsh.bin and install a shell
   script called ${prefix}/bin/sqsh. This shell script will do the 
   following:

       o  Automatically set your $SYBASE to the one used when
          'configure' was run.
       o  Automatically set your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or $SHLIB_PATH
          on HP-UX) to point to the Open Client (or FreeTDS) library.
   
   NOTE: Because this script overrides any other SYBASE or 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting you may already have in your environment,
   if you move your directories around, you may need to edit
   this script.

8) Install man pages.

   For most machines you simply type:

   $ make install.man

   Which will cause the man page to be copied into ${prefix}/man/man3.
   However, if your machine supports compressed man pages, you may use:

   $ make install.zman

   Which will cause the man page to be compressed and copied into
   ${prefix}/man/man3.Z.

Now if all went well, you have a working program with man pages and
everything.  However, if you ever decide to do the unimaginable, and
get rid of all traces of the program, try:

   $ make uninstall
   $ make uninstall.man

or, if need be:

   $ make uninstall.zman

Building Binary Distribution
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If you wish to build a binary distribution (a tar file that contains
everything needed to install and run the binary you compile), simply 
perform steps 1 through 6, above, and then do a:

   % make dist

This will build a sqsh-<version>.tar.gz file that contains
everything needed to distribute sqsh in binary-only form.

Common Problems
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If your compiler generates warnings about certain variables being
clobbered by a longjmp, then turn off any optimization flags that
may have been set in the Makefile.

Good Luck
-=-=-=-=-

Well, hopefully everything went OK for you.  If you have any problems
or you run across any bugs in the program, contact me at:
