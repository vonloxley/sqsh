                             What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.2.0


                               New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature      - You can now define a variable $readline_histignore with a colon separated
                   list of keywords, or a regular expression, that readline should ignore and
                   not store in the readline history list/file. So if you define for example:

    \set readline_histignore='go:lo:mo:exit:quit:vi:!!:GO'
                   or
    \set readline_histignore='"RE:^[glm]o$|^cd |^exit$|^quit$|^vi$"'

                   then these words, when typed on a line by itself, will not be stored in the
                   readline history list and cannot by retrieved with ^P, ^N or cursor up, cursor
                   down keys (in emacs mode, k and j in vi mode). This will reduce the number
                   of key strokes to type when you want to retrieve a previous entered command
                   line. Also the last word of the previous command line will be available
                   under the Meta-_ key in readline. So when you type:

    1> select count(*) from master..sysdatabases
    2> go

                   You only have to type arrow up, or ^P only once to retrieve the previous
                   select statement again, otherwise the "go" command would be displayed
                   first. Second, the Meta-_ key would contain the string master..sysdatabases
                   so you do not have to completely retype the table name. Otherwise the meta
                   character would contain the keyword "go".

    1> select name from <Meta-_>

                   would be sufficient to get:

    1> select name from master..sysdatabases

                   By default the variable $readline_histignore is NULL and all words typed
                   on input will be stored in the readline history. (Depending on
                   $readline_histsize which is 100 by default). Note that when you want to use
                   a regular expression, the string must begin with RE: and the string must be
                   embedded in single quotes and double quotes to prevent early expansion
                   of the string during variable assignment and printing problems if you
                   \echo $readline_histignore because of the pipe characters. The regular
                   expression is evaluated case insensitive, so uppercase GO would also
                   be ignored. See the GNU regex manual for more information on regular
                   expressions.



2 - Feature      - The \bcp command accepts a slicenumber or a partition name to bcp into
                   if the table is partitioned. For example, if you have a semantically list
                   partitioned table on year and a partition name py2013 exists:

    $> sqsh -SPROD -Uadmin_prod -PadminPRDpwd -Dproddb
    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.1> select * from material where year=2013
    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.2> \bcp -SDTA -Uadmin_dta -PadminDTApwd
                              -i"truncate table tstdb..material py2013" tstdb..material:py2013

                   Or when you have a round robin partitioned table and you want to
                   load data into partition slice number 2:

    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.1> select * from cust
    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.2> \bcp -SDTA -Uadmin_dta -PadminDTApwd tstdb..cust:2

                   There is also a new option to the \bcp command, -T, that will disable
                   character set conversion by the client when data transfer from source
                   to target is in progress. When you receive character set conversion
                   errors, you might try this transit option to solve these errors. Otherwise
                   you might set the sqsh and/or \bcp charset parameter identical to the
                   character set of the database server(s), using the -J parameter.
                   As an example sqsh is started using the utf8 character set and connects to
                   an iso_1 database server:

    [mwesdorp@localhost ~]$ sqsh -SJUPITER -Jutf8
    JUPITER.sa.master.1> cd pubs2
    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.1> select * into tempdb..titles from titles where 1=2;
    (0 rows affected)
    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.1> select * from titles
    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.2> \bcp tempdb..titles
    Msg 4847, Level 16, State 1
    Server 'JUPITER', Line 1
    BCP insert operation is disabled when data size is changing between client and server character sets.
    Please use BCP's -Y option to invoke client-side conversion.

    Command has been aborted.

    Open Client Message

    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.2> \bcp -T tempdb..titles

    Batch successfully bulk-copied to SQL Server

    18 rows copied.
    Clock Time (sec.): Total = 0.0183  Avg = 0.0010 (983.98 rows per sec.)

                   The first BCP operations fails, while the second BCP operation using the -T
                   option succeeds. The data is just passed on in transit without any
                   character set conversion necessary as both the source and target servers use
                   the same character set.



3 - Feature      - Implementation of semicolon_hack2 to allow for multiple semicolons on one
                   line of input. The semicolons will be used as command separator and act as
                   a \go command for regular SQL statements. So now you can do for example:

    echo "cd master;select name from sysdatabases;select name from syslogins;\echo Done;" | \
    sqsh -SDTA -Lsemicolon_hack2=On

                   When you have both semicolon_hack and semicolon_hack2 enabled, the second
                   one will take precedence. When hack2 is enabled, semicolon_hack may be
                   disabled. Semicolon_hack2 will also use $semicolon_cmd to be executed
                   when a SQL buffer is available for processing.
                   Note that the 'cd' command in this example will execute a use database
                   command. The function is available in the sqshrc-2.2.0 example file in the
                   doc directory.


4 - Feature      - When saving the history buffers, first a merge will be performed with
                   the existing history file if variable histmerge=On, to prevent the loss of
                   history buffers saved by another sqsh session. It happened to me too many
                   times that I had one sqsh session open to do some real work and another
                   session to monitor server status with sp_who, sp_lock, sp_showplan, etc.
                   When I then quit the first session followed by quitting the second session,
                   I then would end up with only a bunch of sp_who, sp_lock statements in
                   my history file as the second sqsh session would have completely overwritten
                   the history file again.
                   As usual this new feature is off by default, so you have to explicitly
                   enable it by specifying \set histmerge=On or set it in in the .sqshrc file.
                   It is also recommended to use histunique=On when you enable histmerge.

                   Note that this can also lead to strange side effects if you have the
                   hist_auto_save option on and another user is logged in with the same
                   Unix/Linux account and is also using sqsh. This is often the case when multiple
                   DBA's ssh into the same sybase account on the database server hostmachine.
                   If your session automatically saves the history buffers after a configured
                   number of changes, then your history may all of a sudden contains the
                   SQL executed by your colleagues as well, as the history of both sessions will
                   be merged eventually. But after all, basically the same might happen with the
                   bash history file in that kind of situation.



5 - Feature      - You can create a TDS trace file and a protocol log file that can be translated
                   with Ribo. When sqsh is build with DEBUG enabled in the Makefile and you enable
                   debugging for TDS with the -lTDS startup flag or execute \set debug=TDS followed
                   by a \reconnect , and the variables debug_tds_logdata and/or debug_tds_capture
                   are set to specify a filename, then CT-library will write extensive logging
                   information.
                   The TDS capture file can be translated with Ribo. To be able to create
                   debug_tds_logdata, sqsh must dynamically link to the Sybase devlib libraries
                   (Add $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/devlib in front of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH),
                   or have been statically linked with these libraries.
                   Note, this option is for administrators who wants to debug Client-Server
                   communication. See Sybase documentation on ct_debug for more information.
                   This features makes use of the ct_debug call that is available from
                   OpenClient and SDK version 12.5.1.



6 - Enhancement  - The \connect (and also \reconnect) command installs a SIGINT signal handler
                   in sqsh-2.2.0. This will prevent memory faults and core dumps when you type
                   ^C during \connect or \reconnect.
                   Also when typing ^C during \reconnect will properly return to the original
                   session. This is handy when the server you are trying to connect to does not
                   respond in a timely manner and you do not want to wait for a login timeout.



7 - Enhancement  - The use of the $datetime variable is improved in a number of locations
                   to strip of [] which is used as a filter to hide %S (seconds) when
                   smalldatetime datatypes are used in result set processing. Also %u for
                   milliseconds will be replaced by "000" were appropriate. A minor bug is fixed
                   in the display routine using the $datetime variable if %u was used. The
                   final result skipped the first character after %u in the format definition.



8 - Enhancement  - New debug choices added for HISTORY (or HIST for short) and TDS.
                   When debugging the ENV subsystem, the printed messages of variable names
                   is improved as it sometimes printed a whole line of a script that contained
                   a variable and that variable was being expanded. In order to use debugging
                   you have to uncomment DEF_DEBUG in the Makefile and start sqsh using the
                   -l parameter or set the $debug variable.



9 - Enhancement  - Hide password processing is improved during sqsh startup. First, the whole
                   argument list is searched for -P parameters and only the last one will be used.
                   In previous versions each -P parameter resulted in the startup of a child
                   process that wrote to a pipe and the parent process re-executed itself in order
                   to read from the pipe and hide it's parameter list from the OS process list.
                   Normally speaking you would only supply the -P parameter once, but in theory
                   you can supply the -P parameter many times on the command line, but only
                   the last one will count.
                   Now only one child process is created (fork) that writes the password to
                   a pipe and the parent process will now wait for the child to finish with a
                   call to waitpid() before it continues to re-execute itself and read from the
                   pipe. This will prevent <defunct> child processes that were not properly
                   administered as finished by the parent process in previous versions of sqsh.



10 - Bug fix     - When you exit from sqsh, sqsh will now perform a normal disconnect from the
                   server you are connected to, and only if that fails it uses a CS_FORCE_CLOSE
                   call to ct_close. The same is true for ct_exit which will use a CS_FORCE_EXIT
                   only if a normal ct_exit fails. By doing this, sqsh will properly notify the
                   server that it is disconnecting, by sending a LOGOUT TDS token.
                   Previous versions only performed a CS_FORCE_CLOSE disconnect, which resulted
                   in not sending a LOGOUT token. I noticed with previous sqsh versions for example,
                   that SAP Sybase IQ 15.4 prints error messages in the server logfile when a
                   session disconnects using the CS_FORCE_CLOSE flag to the ct_close call.



11 - Bug fix     - The \reconnect command will also save the context prior to - and restore
                   the context after a \reconnect failure, as it already did with the connection
                   information. In previous sqsh versions the context was left in an undefined
                   state when a \reconnect to a server failed and the original connection was
                   restored.  That left the connection basically useless and you had to quit sqsh
                   altogether in that situation. Now you can successfully go on with the original
                   session.



12 - Bug fix     - Fixed an encryption bug with the \lock command. The \lock command is used to
                   lock the current sqsh session. Normally speaking a user who is using sqsh in
                   a xterm in a X-Windows environment, would lock the screen to disable
                   unauthorized access when the user stepped away from the computer. But when
                   you start sqsh from a console, you can use the \lock command just to do that.
                   You can assign a password to the variable $lock, that must be typed to
                   unlock a sqsh session that was locked. But you can also use the UNIX password
                   from the login if sqsh was linked with the -lcrypt library.
                   The \lock command will then use the password from /etc/password or
                   /etc/shadow. However, the method to encrypt the typed password to be able to
                   compare it with the stored password was in error. As a consequence the
                   encrypted passwords never matched and thus the session could never be unlocked
                   and it could only be killed.
                   Note that /etc/password and/or /etc/shadow need to be readable by sqsh in
                   order to read the encrypted password.



13 - Bug fix     - Sqsh stores all its variables in a global environment (g_env) that is basically
                   a kind of hash table. In some situations sqsh can start a transactional save-point
                   on this global environment, which means that all changes can be logged and
                   depending on results can be committed or rolled back. So changes to the variable
                   list can be an addition of a new variable, deletion of an existing variable or a
                   modification of the value of a variable. When a variable is queried then sqsh first
                   searches its global environment, and if the variable does not exist there, then
                   it goes to the OS environment to try to obtain the variable from there.
                   When you start sqsh and do not specify a servername with the -S parameter then
                   sqsh will try to obtain the contents of the DSQUERY variable. As this variable does
                   not initially exist in the global environment, it is obtained from the OS
                   environment.
                   When you then tried to \reconnect to another server using \reconnect -S<newserver>
                   then sqsh would create a new global environment variable named DSQUERY within a
                   g_env transaction. When the connection attempt failed, the transaction would be
                   rolled back and the DSQUERY variable should be deleted from the internal
                   environment, so that subsequent DSQUERY searches would go to the OS environment
                   again. However, due to some missing code, the addition of a new variable to g_env
                   was not logged and thus not deleted during the roll back.
                   When the connection attempt failed, then the global DSQUERY variable still
                   contained the name <newserver>. Subsequent DSQUERY lookups would result
                   in <newserver> instead of the contents of the OS environment variable DSQUERY.
                   This would then specify the wrong servername in your prompt for example.

                   When adding new variables during an active save-point, the variable will
                   now be added to the internal log and when the save-point is rolled-back,
                   the variable will now be properly deleted.
                   In sqsh-2.2.0 a number of variables that were initially missing in the global
                   environment are defined there now from the start. This diminishes the probability
                   of strange behavior when sqsh looks up a variable and find it accidentally in the
                   OS environment. These variables are:

                     autouse, debug_tds_logdata, debug_tds_capture, histmerge, readline_histignore,
                     script, semicolon_hack2, tds_version.



14 - Bug fix     - When sqsh was started with the -i parameter to specify a script file,
                   the filename was stored in the ${0} global internal environment, but was
                   never retrieved from there when expanding ${0}. Instead, expanding ${0}
                   resulted in retrieving the name of the sqsh program name from another internal
                   program structure. This is fixed now so that ${0} inside a script file will
                   correctly expand to the script file name or to the function name when sqsh
                   is executing a named function.



15 - Bug fix     - Usage message of \do is improved.
                   Usage message of \hist-load is fixed.
                   Usage message of \hist-save is fixed.



16 - Bug fix     - Using the \read command to assign a value to a variable by redirecting from
                   an input file from the sqshrc or session file was broken. This is now fixed.
                   The corresponding Sourceforge bug report is 1392951.
                   You can now use the following construct in a session (or sqshrc) file:

    \if [ ( "$DSQUERY" = "NEPTUNE" -o "$DSQUERY" = "JUPITER" ) -a "$username" = "sa" ]
        \read password < $HOME/.sqsh/sa_universe.pwd
    \fi
                   So you can connect with: sqsh -SNEPTUNE -Usa for example and the connect
                   procedure will execute the session file and set the correct password from
                   the file.
                   Note that you must supply the full pathname to the input file, otherwise
                   sqsh would try to locate the file in the current directory. That brings me to
                   the next fix in this area: When sqsh was unable to open the file because it
                   does not exist, then sqsh would output: "sqsh: No error".
                   That had to do with the fact that a call to a function to set the error message
                   also used another function call to produce the filename, and that call intervened
                   with the error administration by setting the error code back to zero and thus
                   the \read command was not able to produce the correct error string anymore. Do
                   still follow me? Well, nevertheless, that is also fixed now and correct error
                   messages will be produced with redirected files (both > and <). For example,
                   suppose we want to write to an existing file in /tmp but we do not have
                   permissions to write to that file:

    [101] JUPITER.sa.tempdb.1> sp_who
    [101] JUPITER.sa.tempdb.2> go > /tmp/file_owned_by_root
    sqsh: Unable to open /tmp/file_owned_by_root: sqsh_open: Permission denied

                   Older sqsh versions would produce the "sqsh: No error" message.


17 - Code fix    - Solved a couple of compiler warnings that were generated when using gcc -Wall.
                   Most of them are regarding unused variables, type cast problems, uninitialized
                   variables, etc. See below for a description of the changes per source file.
