Features I don't want to forget about:

1. \if, \elif, \endif syntax

   I have some ideas, but I really want to think this through. For
   example with:
   
     \if (expression)
   
   will expression *always* be an external unix command?  Do I need
   to come up with another type of function (something different then
   a sqsh command) that can replace things like 'test', 'access', etc.?
   
   Within:

     \if (expression)
        select count(*) from syspickles
     \endif
   
   Will the select actually happen, or does it need an explicit "go"?
   Such as 

     \if (expression)
        select count(*) from syspickles
        \go
     \endif
   
   Inquiring minds want to know.

2. .netrc style password file

   Before I dive into this I want to explore an \if, \elif, \endif
   construct.  This would provide something far more flexible. For
   example:

     \if (test "$DSQUERY" = "SYB_PICKLES")
        \set password=ickypoo
     \elif (test "$DSQUERY" = "SYB_STINK")
        \set password=yukcy
     \endif

3. A read command

   So you could have interactive scripts like:

      \echo -n "Name: "
      \read $name
      select * from sysobjects where name like "$name"

4. Allow the \abort and \exit commands to take an error code

   Once again, this would be primarily useful with if-then-else logic,
   such as:

      \if (test "$severity" -gt "10")
         \exit 128
      \fi
