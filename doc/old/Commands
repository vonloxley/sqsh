1.0   A Simple Command

Implementing a new command within sqsh is a relatively simple
task; all commands are implemented as if they were their own
stand-alone program.  For example, a simple command to display 
the string "Hello World" when executed is:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "sqsh_config.h"
    #include "cmd.h"

    int cmd_hello( argc, argv )
      int    argc;
      char  *argv[];
    {
       printf( "Hello World!\n" );
       return CMD_LEAVEBUF;
    }

Look familier?

As with any C program, the command function acts as a main(), 
recieving a count of the number of arguments passed to the 
function, argc, as well as an array of pointers to the value
of these arguments, argv.

Thus, if the user enters:

   1> \hello a b c

then:

   argc    = 4
   argv[0] = "\hello"
   argv[1] = "a"
   argv[2] = "b"
   argv[3] = "c"

The only difference between a sqsh command and a standalone C
program is that you should not call exit() to return from it,
instead one of the return values described below should be
returned.


2.0  Return Values

The value returned from a sqsh command indicates to the caller
(usually the \loop command) how it should behave, usually with
respect to the current SQL Buffer that the user is typing in.

The following are the valid return values from a sqsh command:

   CMD_FAIL       Indicates that something went wrong while
                  the command was executing.  If $clear_on_fail
                  is set to on, then the current SQL Buffer 
                  will be cleared.

   CMD_LEAVEBUF   The command succeeded, and the SQL Buffer
                  should remain untouched.  Commands such as
                  \echo typically return this value.
     
   CMD_ALTERBUF   The command succeeded and altered the SQL 
                  Buffer. If sqsh is in interactive mode then
                  the contents of the buffer will be redisplayed
                  upon returning.  Commands such as \vi return
                  this value.
  
   CMD_CLEARBUF   The command succeeded, and the current SQL
                  Buffer should be cleared of its contents.
                  The \go command returns this value.

   CMD_EXIT       Requests that \loop exit.  When the last 
                  \loop completes, sqsh will exit. Commands
                  such as \exit return this value.

   CMD_ABORT      Requests that sqsh exit with an exit code of
                  255.


3.0  Making it Available

Simply writing a new command is not quite enough to make it
available from the command line of sqsh, however getting it
set up is very simple.

The prototype for all commands are placed in cmd.h, like so:

    int  cmd_hello _ANSI_ARGS(( int, char** ));

The _ANSI_ARGS() macro is provided as a shield for non-ANSI
C compilers.  It will automatically strip off the argument
prototypes when older K&R compilers are used.

Further down in the cmd.h file is a look-up table that maps
the name of the command to the actual C function.  Adding a
new entry to this table will make the function visible to 
the sqsh command line:

    static cmd_entry_t  sg_cmd_entry[] = {

        /* COMMAND          ALIAS          FUNCTION  */
        /* ------------     ----------     --------  */
        { "\\hello",        NULL,          cmd_hello },
        ...
    };

In this name the COMMAND is the name that of the command that
will be visible to the user (note that if the command is to
start with a \, then the \\ is required to ensure that the
\ will not be interpreted as an escape character).

Currently the ALIAS column is unused.

The FUNCTION column contains the name of the C function that
is to be called when COMMAND is executed.

Thats it!  You have now implemented your first sqsh command.

But wait, there's more...


4.0  Globals

As you have seen, it is possible to write a sqsh command without
knowing anything other than how to implement a very simple
C program.  However, once difference between a standalone C
program and a sqsh command, is that several global variables
can be made available to your command by simply including the
file:

    #include "sqsh_global.h"

These globals contain such things as a the database connection 
currently in use by sqsh, and the internal sqsh environment 
variables.

The following table outlines all of the global variables available
for use within a sqsh command:

    Type           Name          Description
    -----------    ---------     -----------------------------------------
    CS_CONTEXT*    g_context     The global CT-Lib context structure used
                                 to establish the sqsh connection.  This
                                 variable will be NULL if sqsh has not yet
                                 connected to a database.

    CS_CONNECTION* g_connection  Current CT-Lib connection used by sqsh.
                                 This variable will have a NULL value if
                                 sqsh has not yet connected to the database.

    env_t*         g_env         Data structure containing all sqsh en-
                                 environment variables.  See the section
                                 _Environment_Variables_, below, for how
                                 to manipulate this data structure.
   
    env_t*         g_internal_   Contains environment variables internal
                   env           to sqsh's functions, such as $1..$n. 

    env_t*         g_buf         Contains named SQL buffers.

    varbuf_t*      g_sqlbuf      Represents the current SQL buffer as
                                 entered by the user. Refer to sqsh_varbuf.h
                                 for details on manipulation of the
                                 varbuf_t structure.

    cmdset_t*      g_cmdset      Data structure that represents the func-
                                 tion name/pointer pairs described in 
                                 the _Making_it_Available_ section, above.
                                 Typically you shouldn't need to directly
                                 manipulate this structure.  Details may
                                 be found in sqsh_cmd.h.
   
    alias_t*       g_alias       Represents alias name/body pairs.  
                                 Typically you shouldn't need to directly
                                 manipulate this structure.  Details may
                                 be found in sqsh_alias.h.
   
    jobset_t*      g_jobset      The current list of commands running 
                                 within sqsh, including background jobs.
                                 This is a pretty nasty structure that
                                 you usually will not need.  Details may
                                 be found in sqsh_job.h.

    history_t*     g_history     The complete history of commands that
                                 have been executed within sqsh.  Typicaly
                                 this structure is only altered within
                                 cmd_loop.c and most other functions will
                                 only query it.  See sqsh_history.h for
                                 details.

    char*          g_copyright   The copyright banner and version number.
                   g_version
   
    int            g_password_   True/False, has the password been exp-
                   set           licitly set by the user?
   
    char*          g_password    Password as supplied by the user.

    char*          g_lock        Password for screen lock.  This will be
                                 NULL if the user hasn't set it with the
                                 \lock command.

Although the number and variety of global variables in sqsh can look
a little bit daunting but, in reality, only g_connection, g_env, 
and g_sqlbuf are frequently used.


5.0  Environment Variables

If you haven't noticed already, most sqsh commands lean very heavily 
on the use of environment variables, such as $width and $password,
for configuration of default behavior.  For example, the \go
command uses $width variable to determine the current screen width
when displaying result sets.

Fetching and setting environment variables witin a sqsh command
is relatively simple, using the env_set() and env_get() functions.

     int env_get( env_t *env, char *var_name, char **var_value )
     int env_set( env_t *env, char *var_name, char *var_value )

Thus, if you wish to determine the current value of the width
variable:

     char    *width;

     if (env_get( g_env, "width", &width ) <= 0)
     {
         fprintf( stderr, "width: Variable not defined.\n" );
         return CMD_FAIL;
     }

The env_get() function returns 0 if the named variable does not
exist in the global environment, g_env. -1 is returned if an error
is encountered, and a value of 1 is returned and width will point 
to the appropriate value if the variable is found.

Changing the value of an environment variable is just as simple
as fetching its value:

    if (env_set( g_env, "width", "80" ) == 0)
    {
        fprintf( stderr, "width: Unable to set the value to 80\n" );
        return CMD_FAIL;
    }

The env_set() function returns 1 (or True) upon succesfully changing
the value of of the variable and 0 (or False) if the value could
not be set.  See section 6.0 _Capturing_Errors_, below for how to
determine the reason for a fail condition from either env_set() or 
env_get().

5.1  Defining A New Variable

Although calling env_set() with the name of a new variable will auto-
matically create it, it is sometimes desirable to have a variable 
automatically created for you upon start-up of sqsh.  This features
allows you to make certain assumptions about the contents and
existence of the variable within your code.

All that is required to define a new variable within sqsh is to
add it into the sg_var_entry[] lookup table defined in var.h.

    static var_entry_t  sg_var_entry[] = {

    /* VARIABLE          DEFAULT        SET VAL              GET VAL
       NAME              VALUE          FUNCTION             FUNCTION
       ---------------   ------------   --------------       ------------- */
       { "new_var",      "hi",          NULL,                NULL       },
       ...
     };

The VARIABLE NAME column defines the name of the variable as it will
be referred to with env_set() and env_get().  The DEFAULT VALUE 
contains the value with which the variable will be set to upon
start-up of sqsh.  SET VAL FUNCTION and GET VAL FUNCTION are pointers
to functions that will automatically be called when the value of the
variable is set or retrieved, respectively.  See sections 5.2 and 5.2
below.

5.2  Variable Set Validation Function

When establishing a new environment variable, it is possible to define
a validation function that will be called each time the user (or any
caller of env_set()) attempts to change the existing value of the
variable.  Usually this feature is used to either validate that the
variable is be set to a legal value or to perform some sort of 
processing on its contents.

A variable-set validation function looks like this:

     int var_set_func( env, var_name, var_value )
         env_t   *env;
         char    *var_name;
         char   **var_value;

The env parameter points to the environment in which the variable
is being set, and var_name contains the name of the variable that
is being set.  var_value is a pointer to the value of the variable.

A set validation function may return one of two values: A return
value of True indicates that the validation function succeeded
in whatever processing it needed to do.  A return value of
False indicates that something went wrong, and that env_set()
should not change the existing value of the variable.  It is
customary that a set validation function returning False, also
indicate a reason for the failure using the sqsh_set_error()
function (see Capturing Errors, below).

The var_value pointer is very important.  By changing what it points
to within the body of the validation function it is possible to 
over-ride the value that was passed into env_set(), be the user.
For example, to write a validation function that forces the value
of a variable to be "hi", regardless of what the user attempts 
to set it to, would simply be:

     int var_set_hi( env, var_name, var_value )
         env_t   *env;
         char    *var_name;
         char   **var_value;
     {
         *var_value = "hi";
         return True;
     }

Thus, say this validation function was used on our new_var, we defined
above like so:

    int var_set_hi _ANSI_ARGS(( env_t*, char*, char** ));

    static var_entry_t  sg_var_entry[] = {

    /* VARIABLE          DEFAULT        SET VAL              GET VAL
       NAME              VALUE          FUNCTION             FUNCTION
       ---------------   ------------   --------------       ------------- */
       { "new_var",      "hi",          var_set_hi,          NULL       },
       ...
     };

then the following would happen:

     1> \set new_var="hello"
     1> \echo $new_var
     hi

For a good example, of a validation function that takes advantage of
all of these features, see var_set_bool() in var_misc.c.  This function
allows the contents of the variable to be set using either "1", "0", 
"True", "False", "Yes", "No", or "On" and "Off", and reguardless of
which is used the contents of the variable will always contain either
a "1" or a "0".

5.3  Variable Retrieval Function Function

Converse to the set-validation function, a retrieval (or get-validation)
function is called every time the value of a particular variable is
queried.  These functions are currently used within sqsh for such
things as the $date and $time variables (which return the current
date and time respectively) as well as the password retrieval.

The declaration of the get-validation function is identical to that
of the set-validation function:

     int var_get_func( env, var_name, var_value )
         env_t   *env;
         char    *var_name;
         char   **var_value;

Immediately prior to returning the value of a variable, sqsh will call
this function with env containing the environment in which the
variable is being retrieved, var_name containing the name of the variable
being gotten and *var_value pointing to the string value the variable
is currently set to.

By replacing the string that *var_value is pointing to, the existing
value of the variable may be overridden.  For example, if we wanted
to implement a variable that returned its contents in upper case,
reguardless of the case in which the variable was set, the
retrieval function would look like:

     int var_get_upper( env, var_name, var_value )
         env_t   *env;
         char    *var_name;
         char   **var_value;
    {
       static char new_value[64];
       char   *cptr;
       int     i = 0;
 
       cptr = *var_value;
 
       while (*cptr != '\0')
       {
          new_value[i++] = upper(*cptr);
          ++cptr;
       }
 
       *var_value = new_value;
       return True;
    }


As with the set-validation function, a return value of True from
the function indicates that the retrieval passed validation,
and a return value of False indicates that something went wrong
during the process (for example, a malloc() fails), in which case
it is the author of the validation function's responsibility
to indicate the reason for the error using sqsh_set_error().


6.0  Capturing Errors

As a general rule, all internal sqsh functions that are not user
commands will never display an error message to stdout or stderr,
instead these functions will return an error condition (usually
by either returning False, NULL, or a negative value) and set
a global error condition describing the nature of the failure, much
in the way that the standard C library functions behave.

It is the responsibility of the writer of a new sqsh command
to check the return condition from every sqsh library function
and determine the appropriate response (which is usually to
display the reason for the error then abort), and it is considered
poor programming style to simply ignore error messages and
continue processing (unless you document the rationally behind
this).

The following code demonstrates a simple command that replaces
the basic functionality behind the existing sqsh \set command.
Here, the command retrieves two arguments: the name of the variable
and the value that the variable should be set too, it then
attempts to perform the env_set() required to set the value.
If env_set() returns a failure status (False)--usually do to
either memory allocation failure or a set-validation failure, we 
must inform the user that the set failed.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "sqsh_config.h"     /* Always required */
    #include "sqsh_global.h"     /* Required to get g_env */
    #include "sqsh_error.h"      /* For sqsh_get_errstr() */
    #include "sqsh_env.h"        /* Required for env_set() */
    #include "cmd.h"

    int cmd_simple_set( argc, argv )
      int    argc;
      char  *argv[];
    {
       if (argc != 3)
       {
          fprintf( stderr, "Use: \\simple_set var_name var_value\n" );
          return CMD_FAIL;
       }

       if (env_set( g_env, argv[1], argv[2] ) == False)
       {
          fprintf( stderr, "\\simple_set: %s: %s\n",
                   argv[1],
                   sqsh_get_errstr() );

          return CMD_FAIL;
       }

       return CMD_LEAVEBUF;
    }

The major thing to notice here is the call to sqsh_get_errstr() to
fetch the string description of the current error condition.  
Similarly sqsh_error() may be called to fetch a numeric description
of the failure condition (the symbolic values for these conditions
are available in sqsh_error.h).

Also, pay close attention to the header files that are included with
this particular command.  It is always important to realize the 
portions of the sqsh core modules that you are using and include
the appropriate header files accordingly.

Before ending this section, it is only proper to also describe the
method in which errors are raised within sqsh:

    void sqsh_set_error( errno, fmt, ... )
        int    errno;
        char  *fmt;

This function is called with errno set to one of the symbolic
values described in sqsh_error.h (such as SQSH_E_NOMEM to indicate
memory allocation failures) and fmt containing a format string
suitable for use in printf(), followed by all of the necessary
parameters to the format string.

After calling this function any call to sqsh_get_error() will
return errno, and sqsh_get_errstr() will return the formatted
error string.

Keep in mind that you will typically not need this function within
a command, since a command is expected to display any error 
condition directly to the screen, however it is approriate to
use this function in such places as variable set- and get-validation
functions, described above.


7.0  Parsing Arguments

Experienced C programmers should be familier with the standard
libc function getopt(), used to parse command line options 
recieved through the `argv' parameter to main.  Unfortunately,
this particular function may not be used within sqsh, due to
some limitations in dealing with being called repeatedly
within the same program with different `argc' and `argv' values.

To get around this limitation, and to add a little extra function-
ality, sqsh provides the sqsh_getopt() function that behaves
in a similar manner:

     #include "sqsh_getopt.h"

     extern char *sqsh_optarg;
     extern int   sqsh_optind;

     int sqsh_getopt( argc, argv, optstring )
         int   argc;
         char *argv[];
         char *optstring;

The arguments `argc' and `argv' are the argument count and array
as passed into the sqsh command upon invocation.  Any element
of argv[] that starts with a `-' is considered an option, with
the character following the `-' considered an option character.
If sqsh_getopt() is called repeatedly with the same argc and
argv pair, it returns successively each of the option characters
from each of the option elements, finally returning EOF when there
are no more option characters left to return.

As it procedes the `sqsh_optind' variable is updated internally,
keeping track of the current index into the arv array. Also,
as it procedes the contents of `argv' are permuted such that 
all non-options are at the end of the array, and upon completion 
the `sqsh_optind' variable will point to the first element of 
the argv[] array that is not an option.

The `optstring' is a string that contains a list of legitimate
option characters.  If the character is followed by a colon,
then the option requires an argument.  If the character is
followed by a semicolon, then the option accepts an optional
argument (`sqsh_optarg' will be NULL if the argument is not sup-
plied).  All other characters take no argument.

If, while parsing `argv', sqsh_getopt() detects an option that
is not contained with `optstring' a `?' is returned indicating
an error, and the error condition is fetchable via sqsh_get_errstr().

The following sample demonstrates the use of sqsh_getopt():

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include "sqsh_config.h"
   #include "sqsh_getopt.h"
   #include "cmd.h"

   int cmd_argtest( argc, argv )
      int   argc;
      char *argv[];
   {
      extern  int   sqsh_optind;
      extern  char *sqsh_optarg;

      int     ch;
      char   *ofile = "default.out";
      int     aflag = 0;
      int     bflag = 0;
      int     err   = 0;

      while ((ch = sqsh_getopt( argc, argv, "abo:" )) != EOF)
      {
         switch (ch)
         {
            case 'a':
               if (bflag != 0)
                  ++err;
               else
                  ++aflag;
               break;
            case 'b':
               if (aflag != 0)
                  ++err;
               else
                  ++bflag;
               break;
            caes 'o':
               ofile = sqsh_optarg;
               break;
            default:
               ++err;
         }
      }

      if (err != 0 || sqsh_optind != argc)
      {
         fprintf( stderr, "Usage: ...\n" );
         return CMD_FAIL;
      }

      ...
   }

In this example, cmd_argtest accepts two mutually exclusive 
flags, `-a' and `-b', and one option o which requires and 
option argument.  By checking `sqsh_optind != argc', following
the call to sqsh_getopt() it then assures that there are no
more arguments left on the command line.
