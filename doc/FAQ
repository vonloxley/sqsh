Section 1:  Introduction to Sqsh and how to install it

1.1  What is it?

  Sqsh is a replacement for the 'isql' program supplied with Sybase's
  SQL Server database on UNIX platforms.  Besides supporting or emu-
  lating most of the features that isql provides, sqsh provides a
  reasonably rich set of features that users have been asking of isql
  for the last couple of years.
   
  In their basic forms, both isql and sqsh, are simply command line 
  tools used to send queries to a SQL Server or Open Server and display 
  the result set in a (questionably) readable form.

  sqsh was written by Scott C. Gray (gray@voicenet.com, sgray@inventa.com)
  plus various patches submitted by other users throughout the 
  internet.

1.2  What makes sqsh different?

  Sqsh attempts to meld the basic requirements of isql with the features
  of bourne shell, such as file redirection, piping, command aliasing,
  variables, backgrounding, job control, history, and dynamic configuration.
  It also provides several SQL-specific enhancements including multiple
  display styles (including HTML for use in CGI applications), the
  ability to BCP result sets between servers, and execute remote procedure
  calls directly.

  For a complete list of features, please refer to the manual page
  supplied with the program; a lot of effort went into writing it.

1.3  What is the current release?

  The current release of sqsh is 2.5.

1.4  Basic requirements

  In order to compile sqsh, you will need the following:

  1.  A decent C compiler
      Theoretically, sqsh should compile on older K&R compilers, but
      this hasn't been confirmed.  Currently sqsh is developed using
      gcc 4.x using '-g -O -Wall'.

  2.  Open Client/C from Sybase or FreeTDS
      All versions of sqsh prior to 1.4.1 require the availability of
      Sybase's DB-Library.  As of sqsh-1.4.1 and later require Sybase's
      CT-Library or FreeTDS (http://www.freetds.org).
      
      Sqsh has been tested almost all versions of DB-Library as well
      as CT-Lib 10.0.x, 11.1.x, 12.x and 15.x. Note that there is little
      effort underway to allow sqsh to continue compiling against
      CT-Lib 10.x and 11.x, so it may require a bit of work on your part if
      you really need 10.x or 11.x support.

  3.  GNU Readline 5.x, 6.x
      Although this library is not required, it is highly recommended
      if you will to take advantage of command-line history, and key-
      word completion.  Readline may be found at 
          http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/
          http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html

  4.  X11R4 or Later
      If available, sqsh may be compiled such that a result set may
      be displayed within a separate X window.  This requires the
      standard Athena widget set (Xaw).
   
   Obviously, in order to use sqsh, you will need a SQL Server or Open
   Server to communicate with.

1.5  Sources of Information

   The SQSH Homepage may be found at:

              http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqsh

   Sqsh comes with a pretty extensive set of documentation:

       README              -  Basic introducation to sqsh and its features
       INSTALL             -  Build and installation guide
       COPYING             -  GNU copyleft license
       CHANGES             -  Documentation changes since sqsh-2.1.6
       AUTHORS             -  Who wrote sqsh and who is maintaining it.
       doc/FAQ             -  This file
       doc/sqsh.1          -  Sqsh manual page in 'roff -man' format
       doc/sqshrc-2.5      -  Advanced config example enabling recent features

   Please make sure you read at least FAQ, README and INSTALL before asking
   building and installation questions, and read the manual page before
   asking usage and command questions.

1.6  Supported Platforms

   Well, the idea of "supported" does not really apply to freeware, 
   however sqsh has been known to compile and work on most UNIX
   platforms supported by Sybase, including Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, 
   IRIX, SunOS, NCR, Dynix, OSF/1, DEC Unix, SCO, NeXT.  Some systems 
   are a little trickier than others to get sqsh to build (such as Dynix),
   but it gets a little better with every release.  Also, with release 1.7
   sqsh will now run on NT with the help of the Cygwin porting kits.

1.7  Unsupported Platforms

   Sqsh will not currently work with OS/2 or MacOS <= 9.x. I haven't
   seen it running on Mac OS X, however it should work just fine with
   FreeTDS.

1.8  Where do I get it?

   Currently, the only available location to get sqsh from is
   the Sourceforge project page:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqsh

Section 2:  Features

This section is currently under construction. Check the man page or the file
CHANGES for a comprehensive explanation of all features and possibilities.

Section 3:  Common build and installation problems

3.1  Basic instructions

   Make sure you read README and INSTALL included with the installation
   before attempting to build sqsh, but the basic routine is:
   
       % gunzip -c sqsh-X.Y.tar.gz | tar xvf -
       % cd sqsh-X.Y
       % ./configure --prefix="/<install_dir>" --with-x --with-readline
       % vi Makefile src/Makefile
       % make
       % make install
       % make install.man
   
   What could be easier? :) Well, there is also a conf.sh file in the root
   directory that may help you in setting the correct compiler flags, etc.
   Edit this file to your platform needs and run ./conf.sh instead of
   ./configure
   Basically conf.sh will run configure for you with the appropriate
   settings.

3.2  I cannot get 'configure' to run while building GNU Readline

   This section only applies to really old versions of readline
   (< 2.2).

   While running GNU Readline's 'configure' script you get a message
   about not being able to find 'install-sh'.

   Although this is really a problem with the GNU Readline library
   it gets asked often enough to make its way here.  It seems that
   GNU Readline is no longer being developed, but you may want to
   bug the developers to fix it.

   Basically here is the solution: while sitting in the readline-2.0
   directory, do:

      % touch install.sh
      % configure
      % make

   this will allow configure to complete, but it will mean that you
   must hand install readline.  Then to install readline, create the
   install directories if necessary (/usr/local is simply an example,
   you can use whatever you want):

      % mkdir /usr/local/lib
      % mkdir /usr/local/include
      % mkdir /usr/local/include/readline
   
   then copy the necessary files in:

      % cp libreadline.a  /usr/local/lib
      % cp chardefs.h history.h keymaps.h readline.h tilde.h \
           /usr/local/include/readline
   
   and finally, make sure everything has the correct permissions:

      % chmod 755 /usr/local/lib /usr/local/include 
      % chmod 755 /usr/local/include/readline
      % chmod 644 /usr/local/lib/libreadline.a
      % chmod 644 /usr/local/include/readline/*.h

3.3  I get errors from ld.so when attempting to run sqsh

   This problem is typically due to the fact that the dynamic linker
   used for the OS either cannot find the Sybase libraries or it
   is finding the wrong libraries.  This problem is usually fixed
   by setting the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

   On many operating systems, when a program is linked with dynamic
   (shared) libraries, the full path to find the libraries is recorded
   in the binary itself.  On other platforms, such as Linux and Solaris
   (well, and Windows), only the name of the library is stored and
   the operating system searches through a default set of directories
   in order to find the necessary libraries at run-time.  By default, 
   these are usually /lib and /usr/lib.  The advantage of this method 
   is that you can test out different versions of the library without
   having to recompile your application; you simply change the search path
   to look in a new directory.

   If, while attempting to run sqsh, you get a message from 'ld.so'
   (that's the name of the program in charge of doing dynamic loading)
   complaining that it cannot open a particular library, such as:

      % sqsh -Usa -Ppassword
      ld.so.1: sqsh: fatal: libcs.so: can't open file: errno=2
      Killed
   
   it is probably due to the fact that the loader doesn't know where
   the Sybase libraries are found.

   There are two ways to correct this:
   
      1. Set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH with:

            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${SYBASE}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
         
         or for csh and tcsh users:

            setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$SYBASE/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
      
      2. If you have root access, you can set this up for all users
         on a system by editing /etc/ld.conf  and then running ldconfig 
         (this may vary on some systems).
   
   For the most part, option #1 is the recommended method of configuring
   your library search path.

   It is very important to watch the order of library directories listed
   in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable due to the fact that
   several Sybase libraries conflict with the naming of several common
   operating system libraries:

      1.  Solaris has libintl.so in /usr/lib
          Even if you build sqsh with the correct libraries, because
          these libraries are shared, the setting of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          may override the actual library that is used at run-time.
          Having /usr/lib in LD_LIBRARY_PATH *before* $SYBASE/lib
          will cause any CTlib app to fail on Solaris.
         
      2.  libtcl.{a,so} from the tcl language
          Sybase has a libtcl.so, and tcl has a libtcl.{a,so}, which
          very often gets installed in /usr/local/lib.  Again, the
          same potential problem applies if you have a libtcl.so
          in two places, and the wrong one is found at run-time.
      
   (thanks to Michael Peppler, author of SybPerl, for this info). The
   above problem will usually manifest itself when running sqsh
   like so:

      % sqsh -Usa -Ppassword
      ld.so.1: sqsh: fatal: relocation error: symbol not found: intlgetenv:
      referenced in /usr/local/sybase/libcomn.so
      Killed
   
   In general it is highly recommended that you *not* place /lib and
   /usr/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

3.4  Building sqsh on Linux

   Sqsh will *not* build on Linux against the *really* old version
   of CT-Lib (10.0.4) that may still be floating around out there.
   It is highly recommended that you get ahold of a more recent 
   version that is bundled with ASE (15.x).

Section 4:  Run-time problems

4.1  Why can't I alias a SQL statement?

   Many users attempt to alias SQL statements or clauses like this:

      1> \alias nrows="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM *!"
      1> nrows syscolumns;
      sqsh: Invalid command

   however it is stated in the manual page that \alias only applies
   to aliasing other sqsh commands.  The above problem can be
   expressed using environment variables as:

      1> \set nrows="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM"
      1> $nrows syscolumns;

4.2  ^C causes coredump on SGI IRIX

   This problem is covered extensively in README.SGI supplied with the
   sqsh distribution. In short it is due to the fact that sqsh requires
   BSD style signals which require a little tweaking on SGI to get it
   to work.


4.3  Why do I get "TDS state" errors when running stored procedures?

   This problem is typically due to turning on traceflag 260 in the
   server (-T260 turns off the sending of done-in-proc packets back
   to the client each time a statement is completed within a stored
   procedure).  While this flag provides some savings in network
   communications between the client and the server, it will break
   virtually any CT-Lib program, including sqsh.  DB-Lib applications
   are typically unaffected by this flag, that is why older versions
   of sqsh and isql are unaffected when turning it on.

   This is a common problem that has yet to be addressed, even in
   current releases of Open Client.

   Trace-flag 260 my be turned on and off by the SA user with:

      1> dbcc traceoff(260)
      2> go
   
   This bug has supposedly been corrected in SQL Server release 11.0.3.1
   and later.

4.4  Why doesn't command line editing work?

   In order to vi-style or emacs-style command line editing support
   you must compile sqsh using the GNU Readline library.
   See section 3.2 for tips on building readline.

   By default, the readline library starts in "emacs" editing mode,
   which uses either the arrow keys or ctrl-p, ctrl-n, ctrl-b, and
   ctrl-f to move around. If, like me, you prefer vi-style editing,
   you need to create a file in your home directory called 
   $HOME/.inputrc containing the following line:

      set editing-mode vi
   
   (Note: this file is used directly by the GNU Readline library, and
   does not have anything directly to do with sqsh).  Refer to the
   readline documentation for other options that are configurable via
   the .inputrc.  However, for those that care, here are the settings
   that I prefer:

      set editing-mode vi
      set horizontal-scroll-mode On
      set show-all-if-ambiguous On
      set visible-stats On
   
   Also note, any program that employs GNU Readline will be affected
   by this file, this includes such programs as gdb and bash.

4.5  Piping output to another program does not work

   This problem usually manifests itself like so:

      1> sp_who
      2> go | more
      1>
   
   the command seems to have executed, but the output just seems to
   go into the bit-bucket.

   This problem is usually due to a bug in some versions of CT-Lib,
   in the way that the library configures itself for Asyncronous I/O,
   and may be tested by placing the following code in a file called
   sqsh_pipe.c:

      /* sqsh_pipe.c - Demo bug in CT-Lib */
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <signal.h>

      static void sigpoll_handler();

      main()
      {
         struct sigaction sa;

         sigaction(SIGPOLL, NULL, &sa);
         sa.sa_handler = sigpoll_handler;
         sigaction(SIGPOLL, &sa, NULL);

         sleep(20);

         printf( "sqsh_pipe: Congratulations, you don't have the bug!\n" );
         fflush( stdout );
         exit(0);
      }

      static void sigpoll_handler()
      {
         printf( "sqsh_pipe: You have the SIGPOLL bug.\n" );
         fflush( stdout );
         exit(1);
      }

   You can compile this with:

      % cc sqsh_pipe.c -o sqsh_pipe

   And test it with:

      1> sp_who
      2> go | sqsh_pipe
   
   If you get the message "You have the SIGPOLL bug." then you have
   the bug in CT-Lib and should get in touch with Sybase Technical
   Support for the latest version of the library.

   For those of you that are interested in this, here is what the
   bug entails.  When CT-Lib creates a socket to talk to the SQL
   Server, it will typically initialize it to use Async I/O, so 
   that the library will receive a signal (SIGPOLL or SIGIO) whenver 
   data is ready to be received from SQL Server.  Now, by default,
   when a socket is initialized to use SIGPOLL, it is set that the
   signal will only be delivered to the process that requested (in this
   case, sqsh).  However, for some reason, the broken versions of
   CT-Lib actually request that the SIGPOLL signal be sent, not
   only to the process that requested the signal, but to any process
   spawned from it.

   In our case, what happens is that when you type:

     1> sp_who
     2> go | more
   
   sqsh will fork() a new process when will then run the program
   "more".  Well, as soon as SQL Server starts sending data to
   sqsh, both sqsh _and_ "more" will receive the SIGPOLL, and
   since most programs aren't written to deal with this signal,
   they will exit immediatly.

   Many, many thanks to Pablo Sanchez (pablo@sgi.com) and Jason
   Thorpe (thorpej@nas.nasa.gov) for helping track down this problem.
