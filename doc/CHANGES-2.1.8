                     What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.1.8


                       New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature     - Dynamic load of keyword list for Readline keyword completion.
	Until now you were only able to use a fixed list of keywords that were
	provided in a file through the "$keyword_file" variable.
	Now you can enable the variable "$keyword_dynamic" and provide a query
	using the variable "$keyword_query" that will be executed each time you
	log in to a server or change database context using the "use <dbname>"
	command. This feature will only work in Sybase ASE and MSSQL servers.

	The default query provided with "$keyword_query" is:

		"select name from sysobjects order by name"

	But you can provide your own query, as long as the first column in
	the result set returns a character datatype string. For example:

          \set keyword_query="\\
            select name from sysobjects \\
            where type in ('U','V','P','S') \\
            union \\
            select name from sybsystemprocs..sysobjects \\
            where type='P' \\
            order by name"

	I have used this feature in an environment with more than 5000 objects
	loaded in the completion list each time the database context was
	changed, and I did not notice any performance degradation while
	switching from database to database or while using the Readline TAB
	completion feature.

	The second part of this feature automatically completes column names
	when you type an object name followed by a dot and then use Readline
	TAB completion. For example, if you type
	1> ....
	2> where syslogins.<TAB>
	then sqsh will show all columns of syslogins that you can auto-complete
	even further by the Readline module. Of course this will only work for
	objects in the current database. Furthermore, the object does not have
	to exist in the keyword completion list itself. These two feature
	parts work independently of each other, as long as keyword_dynamic and
	keyword_completion are enabled.

	Note 1: Readline auto-completion uses a TAB, or TAB TAB, or sometimes
	ESC ESC. It works in sqsh the same way as you use auto-completion of
	filenames in your shell. Settings are controlled in ~/.inputrc or global
	/etc inputrc settings. See the GNU Readline library documentation for
	more info on auto-completion.

	Note 2: In sqsh-2.1.8/doc a file sqshrc-2.1.8 is provided that contains
	appropriate settings for the newest features in sqsh. Note that the
	color prompt settings in this file are optimized for a (xterm) window
	with white background color. Copy this file to ~/.sqshrc and make sure
	you have a directory ~/.sqsh and you are completely ready to use sqsh
	in its full glory.


2 - Enhancement - Check on running background jobs or pending job output before
	exiting sqsh. If you have running jobs in the background that were
	started with "go &", in sqsh-2.1.7 an exit or quit of the parent process
	would also kill the child processes. Now a check is performed to see if
	there are running jobs or finished jobs with pending output. If this is
	the case then a message is displayed:

		"You have running jobs or pending job output"

	In order to exit sqsh anyway, you have to kill your jobs (\kill)
	manually and process pending output (\show) first.


3 - Enhancement - Tilde expansion on command line.
	If you are used to use a ~ in shell commands that will be expanded to
	your HOME directory name, then you can now use them in sqsh as well.
	The tilde will only be expanded in sqsh commands (and their aliases)
	like the "\go" command, not in the SQL buffer.
	For example:

	...
	3> go -m bcp > ~/bcp_format.dat

	Note that this will only work if GNU Readline is compiled into sqsh.


4 - Enhancement - Password retry loop for MSSQL, DCO/ECDA and Sybase Repserver
	connections added.
	If you tried to logon to any other server than Sybase ASE, IQ or ASA
	and you provided the wrong password, then sqsh terminated immediately
	with an error message. Now you get the chance to retype the password
	again and again until you are successfully logged in, provided that
	$password_retry is enabled (and the server does not lock you out after
	an x number of login attempts).


5 - Bug fix     - Improved processing in displaying binary or image data and
	fixed a bug when querying column sysprocesses.sid in MSSQL, which
	resulted in a buffer overflow error.
	Bug report ID: 3079678


6 - Bug fix     - Unable to use "-P -" to provide a password on stdin.
	Bug report ID: 3388213



This version of sqsh has been successfully built and tested on Cygwin 32 bits,
Solaris x86_64, Linux Ubuntu 32bits, Linux CentOS 5.2 64 bits, AIX 5.3L 64 bits.
Also various versions of Readline, Sybase OpenClient (15.5, 15.0) and freetds
(0.83, 0.91) have been used to build and test sqsh-2.1.8.
I hope you enjoy and love this new version of sqsh as much as I do.





                Changed files in sqsh-2.1.8 compared to sqsh-2.1.7

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_connect.c
	Implements feature 1), by setting an internal variable $keyword_refresh
	to 1 in case a Msg 5701 is determined, meaning that a change of
	database occurred or an initial login. The variables denotes that the
	keyword list should be refreshed in the cmd_input loop.

	Also implements enhancement 4), by repeatedly asking for a password in
	case a wrong password was supplied for connections to MSSQL, Sybase
	ECDA/DCO and or Sybase RepServer. Originally this only worked for
	connections to Sybase ASE, IQ and ASA.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_exit.c
	Implements enhancement 2), by checking if child jobs are running or if
	pending job output is waiting for retrieval. If this is the case then a
	message is presented: "You have running jobs or pending job output".
	This is to prevent unintentionally killing child processes if you exit
	the parent sqsh session. If you still want to exit your parent session
	you have to kill all your child jobs first.

	Query running/finished jobs: \jobs [-i]
	Kill running jobs:           \kill <jobnr>
	Show output:                 \show <jobnr> > /dev/null
	Wait for jobs to finish:     \wait ...

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_input.c
	Implements feature 1), by executing a query to refresh the Readline
	auto-completion keyword list when a change of database occurred. This
	is triggered by a variable "$keyword_refresh" that will be set in
	cmd_connect.c by the callback handler in case a "use <database>"
	statement was executed.
	The query that will be run is provided in the variable $keyword_query.
	The default query is: "select name from sysobjects order by name". But
	you can change that in the .sqshrc file for your own convenience to:

	  \set keyword_query="\\
	    select name from sysobjects \\
	    where type in ('U','V','P','S') \\
	    union \\
	    select name from sybsystemprocs..sysobjects \\
	    where type='P' \\
	    order by name"

	for example. If you type a TAB while entering text, Readline will
	search the keyword list for possible completions and presents them or
	just completes the word you were typing if there is only one possibility
	left.
	This feature is enabled or disabled by the variable "$keyword_dynamic".
	The default is "Off", so you have to explicitly set the variable to "On"
	if you want to take advantage of this new feature. Also the variable
	"$keyword_completion" needs to be set with a value greater than zero.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/dsp_desc.c
	Bugfix 5): Improved handling of binary and image datatypes.
	Fix bugreport 3079678.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_buf.c
	Some preprocessing code is moved to sqsh_readline.h for better include
	file handling.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_config.h
	Defines a default value that will be assigned to $keyword_query.
	  "select name from sysobjects order by name"
	Also sets SQSH_VERSION to the string "sqsh-2.1.8".

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_job.c
	Implements enhancement 3), tilde expansion on the command line. If you
	type:

	1> select name from syslogins
	2> go | grep sa_ > ~/tmp/sa_logins.out

	for example, the tilde will be replaced with your home directory. You
	can use any valid ~name that can be expanded to the corresponding home
	directory of the specified login name, for example ~sybase. Note that
	other expansions like ~+ for $PWD or ~- for $OLDPWD will not work in
	sqsh, as it does in the Bash shell. You will need Readline compiled in
	to use this feature (./configure --with-readline ...)

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_main.c
	Implemented a fix for passing on passwords through stdin with -P -
	Fix for bug 6).

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_readline.c
	Implements feature 1), dynamic column name expansions when you type
	a TAB (or double TAB) after an object name followed by a dot.
	For example type: select sysprocesses.<TAB> ...then sqsh will show you
	all the available column names of the sysprocesses table, provided that
	you are in the master database of course. So the object must exist in
	the current database. This feature will only work if variables
	"$keyword_dynamic" and $keyword_completion are enabled.
	Also all the reserved keywords in ASE 15.7 that were not already on the
	list, are added to the default keyword completion list. This list will
	be used if you do not provide your own list through the "$keyword_file"
	variable and "$keyword_dynamic" is disabled. Again, you will have to
	compile GNU Readline in sqsh to be able to use this feature.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_readline.h
	Moved some of the prototypes and include file definitions from some C
	source files to this local include file.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/var.h
	Replaced the hardcoded sqsh appname by the preprocessor variable
	SQSH_VERSION. This variable is defined in sqsh_config.h and set to
	the string sqsh-2.1.8.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/var_readline.c
	Removed some of the prototypes and the inclusion of
	<readline/readline.h> here and replaced them with an include of
	"sqsh_readline.h".
