What is SQSH?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Sqsh (pronounced skwish) is short for SQshelL (pronounced s-q-shell),
it is intended as a replacement for the venerable 'isql' program supplied
by Sybase.  It came about due to years of frustration of trying to do
real work with a program that was never meant to perform real work.

Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt (a la 'dsql', from David B. Joyner),
it is intended to provide much of the functionality provided by a good
shell, such as variables, aliasing, redirection, pipes, back-grounding,
job control, history, command substitution, and dynamic configuration.
Also, as a by-product of the design, it is remarkably easy to extend
and add functionality.

Sqsh was developped by Scott C. Gray, and is currently maintained by
Michael Peppler (mpeppler@peppler.org)
