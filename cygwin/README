Building sqsh on Windows in the Cygwin environment

Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) is a free Unix-like environment (complete
with X Window server, bash, etc.) that you can install on Windows
machines. sqsh and other Unix tools can be built in that environment
and then used to access resources/servers/etc as if you were using a
Windows program.

Building sqsh in the Cygwin environment requires a couple of
non-standard operations both because the configure script
hasn't been adapted for Cygwin, and because sqsh can't use the
Sybase DLLs directly.



          Building sqsh for Cygwin using Sybase Open Client 15.x

1) To be able to link the compiled sqsh object files with the Sybase client libraries
   to a working sqsh executable, you will need the libsybcs.a, libsybct.a and libsybblk.a
   link libraries, which are also provided in the cygwin directory. These libraries are
   generated from the files libsybblk.lib libsybcs.lib libsybct.lib in the
   %SYBASE%\%SYBASE_OCS%\lib directory. The files provided are based upon version OCS 15.7
   EBF20835 ESD #5.
   To generate your own versions of these libs, you can use the script cygwin-syb15.sh.
   Make sure the location of your Sybase installation directory in this script is correct.
   The default is /cygdrive/c/Sybase.
   Run this script from the cygwin directory and you will have three new library files:
   libsybblk.a, libsybcs.a and libsybct.a. Copy these files to /usr/local/lib or
   any other location you want, or just keep them here in the cygwin directory.

2) Check the Makefile-syb15 for the default Sybase OCS-15_0 location in variable
   SYBASE_OCOS on line 25 (default location is /cygdrive/c/Sybase/OCS-15_0).

   SYBASE_OCOS   = /cygdrive/c/Sybase/OCS-15_0

   and the SYBASE_LIBS entry on line 46 must point to the directory where you copied
   the libraries into, in the previous step. Default is /usr/local/lib.

   SYBASE_LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -lsybblk -lsybcs -lsybct

   If you want X and Motif support, you also have to uncomment the appropriate
   entries in the Makefile.

3) Go to the sqsh root level and do an export to your Sybase root level in Unix format
   and run configure:

     export SYBASE=/cygdrive/c/Sybase
     ./configure --with-readline # optional --with-x --with-motif

   If you run into errors you probably miss some Cygwin development packages.
   Install these missing packages and retry the ./configure. When succesfull, this will
   generate some required installation files like src/config.h for example.
   Now copy the Cygwin makefile to the src directory. This will overwrite the generated
   Makefile with the Cygwin Makefile you just edited in the previous step:

     cp cygwin/Makefile-syb15 src/Makefile

4) Now you can run
     make
     make install
     make install.man

   By default, sqsh will be installed in /usr/local/bin. Make sure this directory is
   in your PATH.

5) Install a .sqshrc file in your $HOME directory. There are some examples in the doc
   directory. If you choose the sqshrc-2.1.9 file as a template,
   you will also have to create a $HOME/.sqsh and $HOME/tmp directory.
   Please note that this template will use a prompt and text color scheme that is fitted
   for a white background. Adjust the prompt and text color definitions accordingly to
   your terminal color scheme.

     cd sqsh-2.1.9/doc
     cp sqshrc-2.1.9 $HOME/.sqshrc
     cd $HOME && mkdir .sqsh && mkdir tmp

6) Make sure you have a valid sql.ini file in your %SYBASE%\ini directory.

7) Some recent installations of Sybase OpenClient and SDK version 15.x do not properly
   set the SYBASE and SYBASE_OCS environment variables in the users variables region of
   Windows XP, 7, e.a.
   So make sure these variables are defined correctly. SYBASE points to the root
   installation directory (C:\Sybase for example), SYBASE_OCS contains the value OCS-15_0.
   The variables can also be defined as string values in the registry in
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SYBASE\Setup.

8) Now you should be able to run sqsh from a cygwin terminal.





          Building sqsh for Cygwin using Sybase Open Client 12.x.

1. Generating the appropriate libXXX.a files
   The cygwin.sh script in this directory can be used to generate
   these files (libblk.a, libcs.a and libct.a). HOWEVER - this script
   does not generate usable files with recent (12.5.1 and later)
   versions of OCS. This directory includes copies of these "libraries"
   that you should be able to use. Note that these .a files aren't
   real libraries - they just document the entry points to the DLLs.

2. config.h
   This file is normally generated by the configure script. You can
   either use the one provided (which should work), or run configure
   yourself to generate this file.

3. Makefile
   The Makefile in this directory has been tailored for use with
   Cygwin. To use this file directly you need to update the
   SYBASE_OCOS macro (near the top of the file) to point at your 
   OpenClient installation - it defaults to c:/sybase/OCS-12_5/
   The SYBASE_LIBS macro points at the .a files in this directory,
   and the CPPFLAGS include the extra defines
   (-D_MSC_VER=800 -D_CYGWIN32_) that are needed to build sqsh in
   this environment.

Building:

1. Copy config.h to ../src
2. cd ../src
3. Run "make -f ../cygwin/Makefile"

You should normally now have a sqsh.exe binary in the src directory.

Linn Anderson sent me the following comments regarding Cygwin when 
using FreeTDS:

 First, thanks for sqsh.  I just built it for my cygwin desktop and had
only a little trouble, mostly following the instructions in the cygwin
directory.  What I ended up doing was much easier.  I havn't used the
sqsh much, but the build seems robust.

  Maybe this is all old hat to you, but if it helps, here is what I did:

            Default Freetds install (configure, make, make install)
            Extract sqsh
            SYBASE=/usr/local
            Export SYBASE
            ./configure
            Edit src/Makefile, replacing -ldl with -liconv
            Make
            Make install
            Make install.man
            And of course, edit up some usable interfaces file.

The only problem with the build, out of the box, was -ldl not found and
several links were needed from -liconv.

  Again, thanks.
