                                            Changes in sqsh-2.5

                                New features, improvements and bug fixes:

1 - Feature -     Print messages to File (P2F).
                  With this feature you can now set a threshold on the number of error messages or print statements
                  that will be shown on screen for the current batch. If the threshold is exceeded, the remainder
                  of the messages will be written to a file. The threshold is specified with variable $p2faxm and the
                  filename by $p2fname.
                  By default the threshold variable $p2faxm and the filename $p2fname are set to NULL, which means
                  that the feature is disabled. If the threshold value is set to 0, then the feature is still disabled.
                  If you set both these variables then the feature is enabled when you run SQSH interactively.

                  For example: Suppose a heap table "inventory" exists which is accidentally loaded twice using bcp
                  and you want to build a clustered index on that table while ignoring the duplicate
                  rows. To prevent an overflow of warning messages on screen you now could do:

                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> \set p2fname="~/tmp/sqsh_p2f.out"
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> \set p2faxm=10
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> create clustered index inventory_cx on inventory(id) with ignore_dup_row
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.2> go
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '0'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '1'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '2'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '3'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '4'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '5'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '6'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '7'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '8'
                  Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '9'
                  Warning: Number of printed server messages exceeds p2faxm=10 limit for current batch.
                           Remaining server messages will be printed to file: /home/sybase/tmp/sqsh_p2f.out

                  When you assign a new value to the p2fname variable, the current file is closed and a new one
                  is opened. If the file already exist, then new data will be appended.
                  Note that for each new batch the message counter is reset. This feature is not applicable when
                  running SQSH in batch mode. So when you would execute something like:

                  sqsh -C"create clustered index inventory_cx on inventory(id) with ignore_dup_row" \
                       -Lp2faxm=10 -Lp2fname=/tmp/sqsh_p2f.out

                  the variable settings are ignored and while no output file is specified with the "-o" option
                  nor output redirection is used like "... > result.out 2>&1", the warning messages will go to the
                  terminal screen altogether.
                  Please note that if you enable this feature by default by specifying the variables in the ~/.sqshrc
                  file for example and the threshold p2faxm is set rather low, that the output of sp_sysmon
                  for example may inadvertently be written to a file.

                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set p2faxm=3
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set p2fname=~sybase/tmp/sqsh_p2f.out
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> sp_sysmon "00:00:10"
                  SYBASE.sa.master.2> go

                  ===============================================================================
                  Warning: Number of printed server messages exceeds p2faxm=3 limit for current batch.
                           Remaining server messages will be printed to file: /home/sybase/tmp/sqsh_p2f.out
                  (return status = 0)


2 - Feature -     Implementation of new commands:

            \run: New command that will execute a batch file that allows you to pass on parameters
                  to the script. Suppose you have a simple script file sp_helpdb.sqsh that contains:

                  exec sp_helpdb ${1}
                  \go

                  If you run this script without specifying a parameter, the expanded string is empty and you
                  just would end up executing 'sp_helpdb', displaying the results on all your databases. However,
                  if you specify a database name as parameter, the result would display extended information
                  for just the specified dbname. In previous versions you could start SQSH only on the command line
                  and provide the parameters mixed with other argument options. For example:

                  sqsh -SSYBASE -Usa -i sp_helpdb.sqsh master -D tempdb -e

                  But there was no possibility to start a script from the SQSH prompt and passing on arguments
                  as well. You can use the \loop command to run a script file, but that command does not accept
                  additional parameters. As the \loop command is the heart of SQSH, I did not want to take the risk
                  of breaking existing code, so I implemented this new command "\run". Now you can run from the prompt:

                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> \run -e -i sp_helpdb.sqsh master

                  Other arguments of the \run command are:

                  Use: \run [-e] [-f] [-h] [-n] [-p] [-m style] -i filename [optional script parameters ...]
                       -e          Run the script file with echo on
                       -f          Suppress footers
                       -h          Suppress headers
                       -l          Suppress separator lines with pretty output style
                       -n          Disable SQL buffer variable expansion
                       -p          Report runtime statistics
                       -m style    Specify output style {bcp|csv|horiz|html|meta|none|pretty|vert}
                       -i filename SQL file to run


            \lcd: Local Change Directory. This command takes a directory name as argument and changes the
                  local SQSH context to this directory. You can use "\lcd -" to return back to the previous
                  directory. If you exit SQSH then the shell is still in the same directory from where SQSH was
                  started.


            \pwd: Print Working Directory. Show the name of the current local working directory.


            \ls:  List files in the current directory. The command does not take any arguments and is basically
                  a shortcut for "\shell ls".


3 - Feature -     Readline filename completion. When Readline support is compiled into SQSH, you have the ability
                  to use Readline keyword completion by using the TAB character to complete an objectname. The list
                  of objectnames is a built-in list, or is provided in a file specified by the $keyword_file variable
                  or the list is dynamically created by executing a query specified in $keyword_query each time you
                  switch database context and if $keyword_dynamic is set to True. Note that $keyword_completion must
                  be set to a value of 1 (lower), 2 (upper), 3 (smart) or 4 (exact) to enable this feature.
                  When you type part of a string that cannot be expanded to an objectname, i.e. there is no match,
                  than SQSH tries to complete the string as a filename in the current directory. So what you can do
                  now for example:

                  $> sqsh -SSYBASE -Usa
                  password:
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \lcd $SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/scripts
                  \lcd: local directory changed to: /opt/sybase/ASE-15_0/scripts
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \run -n -i ./instm<TAB>

                  results in the completed filename "./instmsgs.ebf". Note that Readline filename completion ignores
                  the value of $keyword_completion, instead you can set completion-ignore-case to "on" in your
                  ~/.inputrc file if you wish case insensitive filename completion.
                  So as long as there are completion matches in the internally created SQSH object list, no filename
                  completion will be attempted and no possible filename completions will be shown. SQSH will only
                  revert to filename completion if the internal object list is exhausted. In the example above,
                  there are most likely no objectnames in your database that start with "./instm", so SQSH will
                  immediately attempt filename completion on this string.


4 - Feature -     If your server supports SSL connections, i.e. a certificate is installed in the server and a public
                  certificate is available on the client and a SSL filter is specified in
                  $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/config/libtcl[64].cfg like:

                  [FILTERS]
                  ssl=libsybfssl.so

                  you can then start a secure session by specifying:

                  sqsh -Ssybprod1:5001:ssl ...

                  The portnumber used on this connection must be configured for SSL connections in the server. The
                  host may be specified with a name or an IP address.
                  The target server address syntax host:port[:filter] is also supported now with the \bcp command.
                  A workaround is implemented to allow host:port addresses when using the FreeTDS library
                  middleware. Note that FreeTDS does not support SSL connections (yet).


5 - Improvement - The \go command now accepts the option -e to echo the expanded SQL command buffer before
                  sending it to the server and the -l option will suppress the separator lines with the pretty
                  output style. The echo option was already available as a SQSH startup parameter (i.e sqsh -SSYBASE -e)
                  and could be changed by setting the $echo variable to On or Off. Now it is available on a per
                  batch execution basis. For example:

                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> \set WHERECLAUSE="where city like 'B%'"
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> select * from pubs2..publishers $WHERECLAUSE
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.2> \go -e -mpretty -l
      echo -->    SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> select * from pubs2..publishers where city like 'B%'
                  +========+======================================+======================+=======+
                  | pub_id | pub_name                             | city                 | state |
                  +========+======================================+======================+=======+
                  | 0736   | New Age Books                        | Boston               | MA    |
                  | 1389   | Algodata Infosystems                 | Berkeley             | CA    |
                  +--------+--------------------------------------+----------------------+-------+

                  In older versions you had to explicitly set variable 'echo' to on and the pretty
                  output style showed separator lines that could not be suppressed:

                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> \set echo=On
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> select * from pubs2..publishers $WHERECLAUSE
                  SYBASE.sa.tempdb.2> \go -mpretty
      echo -->    SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1> select * from pubs2..publishers where city like 'B%'
                  +========+======================================+======================+=======+
                  | pub_id | pub_name                             | city                 | state |
                  +========+======================================+======================+=======+
                  | 0736   | New Age Books                        | Boston               | MA    |
      sepline>    +--------+--------------------------------------+----------------------+-------+
                  | 1389   | Algodata Infosystems                 | Berkeley             | CA    |
                  +--------+--------------------------------------+----------------------+-------+

                  The -l option on the \go and \run command is a one time option that activates separator
                  line suppression for the current batch or current script file only. There is also a new
                  variable "nosepline" that is a Boolean which defaults to False, but when enabled with
                  \set nosepline=True, in the .sqshrc file for example, will activate pretty separator line
                  suppression permanently and you you do not have to provide the -l parameter to the \go or
                  \run command anymore.


6 - Improvement - Two new read only variables are introduced that contain the date and time SQSH was built.
                  The variables are named builddate and buildtime.

                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \echo "Program $version was compiled on $builddate - $buildtime"
                  Program sqsh-2.5 was compiled on Mar 15 2014 - 11:15:42


7 - Improvement - SQSH now understands the ANSI inner join syntax when using Readline TAB completion on an alias name
                  to display the column names for the related table. In sqsh-2.4 this only worked for the left, right
                  and outer ANSI join syntax.


8 - Improvement - Improved the display of timestamps in the "\history -i" and \snace commands that make use of the
                  $datetime format variable. This variable my contain %q to display milliseconds or microseconds
                  for datetime or bigdatetime datatype columns, but that is not relevant for the timestamps in the
                  command output of "\history -i" and \snace. So the ".%q" will now be filtered out for these commands.


9 - Improvement - The autoconf input files that finally make up the configure script are updated to automatically
                  detect 64 bit compilations and thus setting "CPPFLAGS=-DSYB_LP64" in the src/Makefile as required.
                  Also building SQSH on the Cygwin platform is now fully automated by configure and make.
                  This works on both Cygwin32 and Cygwin64 bits platforms.
                  Furthermore the gnulib installation scripts like config.sub, config.guess and install-sh have
                  been refreshed to the latest version available.


10 - Improvement -In sqsh-2.1.8 tilde expansion on the command line was introduced by using the tilde_expand()
                  function of the Readline package. By default this tilde expansion is rather strict and only
                  works properly if the tilde is preceded by a blank or tab character and followed with a slash,
                  blank space or newline. So for example you were able to use this in a command like

                      SYBASE.sa.master.1> select ...
                      SYBASE.sa.master.2> \go > ~/tmp/result.log

                  but you could not use it in 

                      SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set session="~/.sqsh/session.ini".

                  This is being fixed now by implementing tilde expansion in the sqsh_expand() function (where it
                  obviously belongs). When the tilde is preceded by a blank space, tab, double quote, equal sign,
                  colon, > or < and the tilde name specifier is followed by a slash, blank space, tab, newline,
                  double quote, equal sign or colon, then the tilde will be expanded (still using the readline
                  tilde_expand function), otherwise it will be left alone. If you need a tilde where it would
                  otherwise be expanded, you have to use single quotes or you may escape the tilde with \\~.
                  For example:

                      SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set searchpath='.:~/bin:~/lib:~sybase/bin:~sybase/lib'

                  A tilde will be expanded to your HOME directory and a tilde followed by a unix/linux login name
                  will expand to the home directory for that login, according to the /etc/passwd file.
                  Note that tilde expansion will not occur in the SQL buffer, but only for SQSH commands.
                  With this code change, SQSH is now a little more compliant with tilde expansion in bash.


11 - Bugfix -     Typing a ^C after a \do command was run, resulted in a segmentation fault. This was caused by
                  a faulty interrupt stack that was not popped after the \do command finished.


12 - Bugfix -     Fixed a problem with assigning values to the variables colsep, linesep, bcp_colsep and bcp_rowsep.
                  In previous SQSH versions it was not possible to reset these variables to the default
                  by assigning the 'default' string or a NULL value and the latter resulted in a segmentation fault.
                  It is now possible/easier to assign control characters to these variables, for example:

                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set linesep="\n"
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set linesep=NULL
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set linesep=default

                  The last two commands reset linesep to "\n\t". That is, result rows that exceed the physical width
                  ($width variable) of the terminal window are split in multiple lines and subsequent lines start
                  with a tab character by default.

                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set width=50
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set linesep=default
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> select * from pubs2..publishers where pub_id="0736"
                  SYBASE.sa.master.2> go
                   pub_id pub_name
      tab-->      	city                 state
                   ------ ----------------------------------------
      tab-->      	-------------------- -----
                   0736   New Age Books
      tab-->      	Boston               MA

                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> \set linesep='\n'
                  SYBASE.sa.master.1> select * from pubs2..publishers where pub_id="0736"
                  SYBASE.sa.master.2> go
                   pub_id pub_name
      no tab-->   city                 state
                   ------ ----------------------------------------
      no tab-->   -------------------- -----
                   0736   New Age Books
      no tab-->   Boston               MA


13 - Bugfix -     SQSH (when compiled with FreeTDS to connect to a MSSQL server) will now properly display
                  uniqueidentifier datatypes created by the newid() function. This is basically a workaround
                  in FreeTDS processing, i.e. do not use an explicit cs_convert for this datatype but use native
                  FreeTDS internal conversions instead.

14 - Bugfix -     In several places code has been changed to solve compiler complaints on redeclared objects
                  or to improve code readability. See below for details.

                                 directive on both Cygwin32 and Cygwin64 target builds.
                                 Implementation of feature "P2F": Counter is reset to zero at the start of a new batch.
                                 Support the "-S host:port[:filter]" syntax with the \bcp command to specify a server
                                 address to connect.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd_connect.c   - Renamed _CYGWIN32_ defined checks to __CYGWIN__ in order to be able to use this
                                 directive on both Cygwin32 and Cygwin64 target builds.
                                 New callback function "validate_srvname_cb" introduced to enable a feature to
                                 specify the ssl filter in -Shostname:portname:ssl type of connections.
                                 Allow for -Shostname:portname connections with FreeTDS.
                                 Enablement of feature "P2F".
                                 Improved time display of command \snace in network authenticated connections like
                                 Kerberos.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd_do.c        - Fixed a bug with interrupt handlers.
                                 Implementation of feature "P2F": Counter is set to zero at the start of a new batch.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd_go.c        - New command option -e can now be specified with the \go command to echo the expanded
                                 SQL buffer before it is being send to the server.
                                 New command option -l to suppress separator lines with the -mpretty output style.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd_history.c   - Improvement of displaying timestamps with the "\history -i" command.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd.h           - Definition of new commands \run, \lcd, \pwd, \ls.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd_run.c       - Implements the \run command.

  sqsh-2.5/src/cmd_shell.c     - Implements the \lcd, \pwd and \ls commands.

  sqsh-2.5/src/dsp.c           - Implementation of feature "P2F": Counter is set to zero at the start of a new batch.
                                 Fixed a problem with assigning default or NULL values to the variables colsep,
                                 bcp_colsep, bcp_rowsep and linesep.

  sqsh-2.5/src/dsp_desc.c      - Implemented a fix for the MSSQL uniqueidentifier datatype using FreeTDS. In previous
                                 versions this datatype was displayed using the cs_convert function, but apparently
                                 that did not work correctly in FreeTDS. Now we let FreeTDS CTlib handle this datatype
                                 natively and then it works OK. The display length of the uniqueidentifier datatype is
                                 explicitly set to 36 bytes.

  sqsh-2.5/src/dsp.h           - Definition of flag DSP_F_NOSEPLINE for the "\go -mpretty -l" option.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_expand.h   - Defined EXP_TILDE flag.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_expand.c   - Implemented tilde expansion.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_global.c   - Adapted the copyright string.
                                 Initialize new global variables for the P2F feature (g_p2f_fp, g_p2fc).

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_global.h   - Definition of new variables g_p2f_fp and g_p2fc for the P2F feature.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_init.c     - Close the g_p2f_fp file pointer during sqsh_exit if it is still open.
                                (P2F feature enablement)

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_job.c      - Reset getopt variable list for child processes.
                                 Removed command line tilde expansion from here and implemented it in sqsh_expand.c

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_readline.c - Changed cast of sqsh_completion function to (rl_completion_func_t *).
                                 Implementation of filename tab completion when object list is exhausted.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_readline.h - Changed declaration of external Readline functions to match the declaration in
                                 readline/history.h in case this file is not included from readline/readline.h.

  sqsh-2.5/src/var_ctlib.c     - Skip some tests when variable packet_size is assigned NULL value (default).

  sqsh-2.5/src/var_dsp.c       - Some cosmetic code changes to increase readability.
                                 Improved handling of linesep, colsep, bcp_colsep and bcp_rowsep variables.
                                 The check for a "NULL" value assignment to a variable is now case insensitive.

  sqsh-2.5/src/var.h           - Changed default of variable linesep to "\n\t". Removed variable start_connected.
                                 Defined new variables p2faxm, p2fname (feature P2F), nosepline and read only
                                 parameters builddate, buildtime.

  sqsh-2.5/src/var_debug.c     - The check for a "NULL" value assignment to a variable is now case insensitive.

  sqsh-2.5/src/var_misc.c      - Improved handling of NULL assignments in var_set_esc, var_set_nullint,
                                 var_set_nullstr and var_set_int.
                                 Assignment of "NULL" values to variables is case insensitive now, i.e. you
                                 might execute "\set bcp_colsep=null".
                                 Implementation of a new function var_set_p2fname that handles file opening and
                                 closing when a filename is assigned to the variable p2fname that is being used
                                 by the P2F feature.

  sqsh-2.5/src/var_passwd.c    - The check for a "NULL" value assignment to a variable is now case insensitive.

  sqsh-2.5/src/var_readline.c  - Improved assignment to Readline stifle_value variable in case the assignment
                                 variable is NULL.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_parser/Makefile.in   - Do not remove the generated C files with "make distclean".
                                           Add an option to the 'ar' command that can be set with 'configure' to
                                           allow for 64 bits archive creation on AIX, i.e. -X32_64.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_parser/sqsh_parser.c - Define internal parser functions as static (local). Especially xmalloc
                                           clashed with Readline functions on some target systems.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_parser/tsql.c        - Generated file from tsql.y: include 'stdlib.h' instead of deprecated
                                           'malloc.h'.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_parser/tsql.l        - Correctly process ANSI inner join syntax as well.

  sqsh-2.5/src/sqsh_parser/tsql.y        - Include 'stdlib.h' instead of deprecated 'malloc.h'.



                                            Changes in sqsh-2.4

                                New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1a - Feature  -   Readline auto-completion of aliased objects in the current SQL buffer.
                  In sqsh-2.1.8 dynamic auto-completion was introduced when readline support is also
                  compiled in sqsh and the variable $keyword_completion is set to a value between 1 and 4.
                  (See the sqsh man page for a description of the meaning of these values).
                  You could then enter an object name in the input buffer followed by a dot and using the readline
                  auto-completion sequence (usually 1 or 2 TAB or ESC keystrokes), then a list of
                  available column names would be shown to choose from.
                  With this feature enhancement you can now use an alias name for an object in the SQL buffer and
                  use auto-completion on the alias name as well. For example:

    SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.1> \echo $keyword_completion
    4
    SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.1> select * from master..sysdatabases    d,
    SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.2>               master.dbo.sysusages    u
    SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.3> where  d.<TAB><TAB>
    d.audflags         d.def_remote_loc   d.durability       d.status2
    d.audflags2        d.def_remote_type  d.logptr           d.status3
    d.crdate           d.deftabaud        d.name             d.status4
    d.dbid             d.defvwaud         d.spare            d.suid
    d.defpraud         d.dumptrdate       d.status           d.version
    SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.3> where  d.s<TAB><TAB>
    d.spare    d.status   d.status2  d.status3  d.status4  d.suid
    SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.3> where  d.s


                  So when you type d.<TAB><TAB> (where <TAB> means a keystroke of the TAB key), then sqsh
                  will parse the SQL buffer entered so far and determines that the alias name 'd' actually
                  refers to the master..sysdatabases table. So it dynamically creates a list of columns
                  for this table and shows them on screen.
                  In the second example we have typed 'd.s' already and when we ask for a completion
                  (<TAB><TAB>) then sqsh will produce a list of all column names in sysdatabases that
                  start with a 's'.

                  This feature enhancement is contributed by K.M. Hansche.

1b - Enhancement - Column name auto-completion is now capable of handling cross database object names like in
                   the above example. In previous versions of sqsh you could only use column name completion
                   of objects located in the current database.
                   Please note - in order for this feature to work correctly - you need to specify a
                   fully qualified object name as a consecutive string without spaces. In ASE, for example,
                   it is perfectly valid to code:

    select * from master . dbo . sysdatabases d where d.dbid=1

                  However, sqsh readline auto-completion is expecting an object name master.dbo.sysdatabases.

2 - Feature  -    A new boolean variable 'usedbcheck' is defined that may be set to True (default is False).
                  This will result in a check being performed if sqsh is able to access a database that is
                  provided with the -D parameter while sqsh is run in batch mode. This is to prevent a script
                  file is being executed in the wrong database. Suppose a user 'test_user' is trying to execute
                  a batch script in the pubs3 database, but the database 'pubs3' is in 'dbo use only' mode.
                  The test_user is a normal user in this database. The default database of test_user is pubs2.

    ~$ sqsh -Utest_user -Ptest_user_pw -Dpubs3 -C"select db_name()"
    Msg 923, Level 14, State 1
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    User 6 not allowed in database 'pubs3' - only the owner of this database can access it.
    Msg 10334, Level 18, State 127
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    Permission related internal error was encountered.  Unable to continue execution.
    Msg 10334, Level 18, State 80
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    Permission related internal error was encountered.  Unable to continue execution.

     ------------------------------
     pubs2

    (1 row affected)

                  Although we try to execute a script (or statement in this case with the -C parameter) in the
                  pubs3 database, we end up in the pubs2 database and thus may inadvertently cause a lot of
                  problems when a script file is executed there. When we enable the variable 'usedbcheck',
                  sqsh will abort if it is not able to set the database to the one specified with the -D
                  parameter. Note that we enable the variable here with -Lusedbcheck=On on the command line,
                  but of course you can also permanently enable the variable in the .sqshrc file.

    ~$ sqsh -Utest_user -Ptest_user_pw -Dpubs3 -C"select db_name()" -Lusedbcheck=On
    Msg 923, Level 14, State 1
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    User 6 not allowed in database 'pubs3' - only the owner of this database can access it.
    Msg 10334, Level 18, State 127
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    Permission related internal error was encountered.  Unable to continue execution.
    Msg 10334, Level 18, State 80
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    Permission related internal error was encountered.  Unable to continue execution.
    sqsh: ERROR: Unable to use database 'pubs3' in batch mode

                  Note the error message at the last line. Also note that this feature does not work in interactive mode.
                  So when you start sqsh in interactive mode, that is when you get a prompt, then sqsh will not abort and
                  you have to check the error messages and the sqsh prompt to determine the current database scope.

    ~$ sqsh -Utest_user -Ptest_user_pw -Dpubs3 -Lusedbcheck=On
    Msg 923, Level 14, State 1
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    User 6 not allowed in database 'pubs3' - only the owner of this database can access it.
    Msg 10334, Level 18, State 127
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    Permission related internal error was encountered.  Unable to continue execution.
    Msg 10334, Level 18, State 80
    Server 'SYBPROD', Line 1
    Permission related internal error was encountered.  Unable to continue execution.
    SYBPROD.test_user.pubs2.1>

3 - Fix -         In the situation were a login trigger decided a login attempt should be aborted using syb_quit()
                  and sqsh was called with a -D parameter, then sqsh started to loop producing the output:

                  Open Client Message
                  Layer 1, Origin 1, Severity 1, Number 50
                  ct_results(): user api layer: external error: The connection has been marked dead.
                  Open Client Message
                  Layer 1, Origin 1, Severity 1, Number 50
                  ct_results(): user api layer: external error: The connection has been marked dead.
                  ...

                  This was caused by a callback function that neglected the dead connection while it thought it
                  was still in a login sequence at the time sqsh attempted to execute a 'use <dbname>' command.
                  This is being fixed now so that the callback function will abort sqsh when the connection
                  is marked dead, directly following an unsuccessful login attempt.

4 - Fix -         In sqsh-2.2.0 the \reconnect command code was improved to be able to recover from reconnect
                  failures due to timeouts or an abort request by typing ^C, for example. Unfortunately this broke
                  the ability to use \reconnect inside a \do block. This is being fixed now so that you can use a
                  script again like:

    use dbadb
    \go
    create table srvadmin (srvname varchar(30), dbuser varchar(30), dbpasswd varchar(30), dbname varchar(30))
    \go
    insert into srvadmin (srvname, dbuser, dbpasswd, dbname) values ('SYBPROD', 'dbaprod', 'dbaprodpw', 'monproddb')
    insert into srvadmin (srvname, dbuser, dbpasswd, dbname) values ('SYBTEST', 'dbatest', 'dbatestpw', 'montestndb')
    insert into srvadmin (srvname, dbuser, dbpasswd, dbname) values ('SYBDEV',  'dbadev',  'dbadevpw',  'mondevdb')
    \go
    select * from dbadb..srvadmin
    \do
      \reconnect -S#1 -U#2 -P#3 -c
      select srvname=@@servername, loginame=suser_name(), dbname=db_name(), spid=@@spid
      exec sp__dba_monsrv #4
      \go
    \done

5 - Fix -         Another contribution by K.M. Hansche is a fix in dsp_html.c to produce correct html5 compatible
                  table output when you use the "\go -m html" command to generate result set output in html format.

                                            Changes in sqsh-2.3

                                New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature  -    A new boolean variable $localeconv is introduced that will enable the use
                  of the active Operating System locale with sqsh when displaying the result set
                  for datetime datatypes (DATETIME, SMALLDATETIME, DATE, TIME, BIGDATETIME,
                  BIGTIME) in combination with the $datetime, $datefmt, $timefmt variables and the
                  real, float, numeric, decimal and money/smallmoney datatypes.
                  By default this variable is 0 (off, false) which results in the internal C/POSIX
                  locale being used.
                  (In the sqsh manual page there was a remark with the $datetime variable, stating
                  that the OS locale would always be used to display the datetime results, but as
                  the locale was never actually set in sqsh, the locale would always be C/POSIX by
                  default, anyway).
                  Note that you can set this variable in your .sqshrc file to enable it by default.
                  (\set localeconv=1)

                  For example:

                  $ export LANG=nl_NL.utf8
                  $ locale -ck LC_TIME
                  LC_TIME
                  abday="zo;ma;di;wo;do;vr;za"
                  day="zondag;maandag;dinsdag;woensdag;donderdag;vrijdag;zaterdag"
                  abmon="jan;feb;mrt;apr;mei;jun;jul;aug;sep;okt;nov;dec"
                  mon="januari;februari;maart;april;mei;juni;juli;augustus;september;oktober;november;december"
                  am_pm=";"
                  ...

                  $ locale -ck LC_NUMERIC
                  LC_NUMERIC
                  decimal_point=","
                  thousands_sep=""
                  grouping=-1;-1
                  numeric-decimal-point-wc=44
                  numeric-thousands-sep-wc=0
                  numeric-codeset="UTF-8"

                  $ sqsh -Llocaleconv=On -Ldatefmt="%A %e %B %Y" -C"select convert(date,getdate())"

                  (1 row affected)

                  Note that sqsh will not take grouping of thousands into account. Only the decimal_point
                  or mon_decimal_point will be used in displaying numerical or monetary values.
                  A big thank you to K.M. Hansche who provided the initial code to enable locale
                  conversions.

2 - Enhancement - Another contribution by K.M. Hansche is some code to enable the use of a \for loop command
                  inside a sqsh function definition (the \func command).

3 - Enhancement - Another contribution by K.M. Hansche is some code to produce html5 compatible output when you use
                  the "\go -m html" command to generate result set output in html format.

4 - Enhancement - Display size and justification of datatypes bigint (CS_BIGINT_TYPE), unsigned smallint
                  (CS_USMALLINT_TYPE), unsigned int (CS_UINT_TYPE) and unsigned bigint (CS_UBIGINT_TYPE)
                  adapted. Previously these datatypes were displayed with length 256 bytes and left
                  justification. Display is now right justified and output size is:

                  bigint             20 characters
                  unsigned smallint   5 characters
                  unsigned int       10 characters
                  unsigned bigint    20 characters

                  Also the justification of all datetime datatypes is set to right. This was not the case
                  for DATE, TIME, BIGDATETIME and BIGTIME. Where appropriate, the display size is also fixed
                  for these datatypes.

5 - Enhancement - The datatypes bigdatetime and bigtime will now be correctly processed with microseconds
                  taken into account, even when variables $datetime and $timefmt are not set (i.e. default).
                  Basically, the following defaults will be used for BIGDATETIME = "%b %d %Y %l:%M:%S.%q%p"
                  and BIGTIME = "%l:%M:%S.%q%p". See the strftime manual page for a description of these
                  % variables.

                  1> \set datetime=NULL
                  1> \set timefmt=NULL
                  1> select convert(bigdatetime,getdate())
                  2> select convert(bigtime,getdate())
                  3> go

                   -----------------------------

                  When you set the $datetime and/or $timefmt variables according to the strftime variables
                  that start with %, you now have to use %q to expand milliseconds or microseconds. In
                  previous versions of sqsh the %u variables specified the number of milliseconds, but as
                  %u also specifies the day number of the week (Monday 1 .. Sunday 7), this is now replaced
                  by %q as this was the only free character left. Note that %q automatically expands to
                  microseconds when a bigdatetime or bigtime datatype is used, and expands to milliseconds
                  with regular datetime and time datatypes.

6 - Enhancement - All missing CS_*_TYPES in metadata description processing are being added now. This means that
                  when you request the result set metadata, the data types of the columns are properly
                  shown, instead of <INVALID>. Also some other missing status information from newer Open Client
                  versions are added as well. For example:

                  1> select convert(bigint,1)
                  2> \go -m meta
                  CS_ROW_RESULT
                     CS_BROWSE_INFO        = CS_FALSE
                     CS_CMD_NUMBER         = 1
                     CS_NUMDATA            = 1
                     CS_NUMORDERCOLS       = 0
                     COLUMN #1
                        name      =
                        namelen   =  0
                        datatype  =  CS_BIGINT_TYPE
                        format    =  CS_FMT_UNUSED
                        maxlength =  8
                        scale     =  0
                        precision =  0
                        status    =  CS_UPDATABLE
                        count     =  0
                        usertype  =  43
                        locale    =  0x0x8ad2e70
                     CS_TRANS_STATE        = CS_TRAN_COMPLETED
                  CS_CMD_DONE
                     CS_CMD_NUMBER         = 1
                     CS_ROW_COUNT          = 1
                     CS_TRANS_STATE        = CS_TRAN_COMPLETED


7 - Bugfix -      In sqsh-2.2.0 an annoying bug was introduced when displaying binary data. As the string
                  terminator was not properly set in the output string, the output string could contain
                  garbage and scrambled data. This is being fixed now.

8 - Bugfix -      When the first character on a line of input is the # character, and it is not a potential
                  temporary table name, then sqsh assumed the line contained only a comment and was discarded
                  from the SQL buffer. This could lead to syntax errors in the following situation:

                  /* ############################################
                  #  This is a block of comment that should     #
                  #  be properly handled and added to the       #
                  #  SQL buffer that will be send to the server.#
                  #  ############################################*/

                  What happened in older versions was that only the first line was put into the SQL buffer,
                  but the other lines were ignored. That led to a missing closing comment statement (*/) and thus
                  to a syntax error on the server.
                  When sqsh now determines a # character on the first position in the input stream, it checks
                  the current SQL buffer for any nested level of C style comments. When the buffer started any
                  comment that is not closed yet, the line of input will just be added to the SQL buffer as is.


9 - Bugfix -      Older versions of sqsh could only handle a line of input of max 4096 bytes. When readline support
                  was compiled in, and a larger line of input was read from the input stream, that line of input was
                  copied to a fixed buffer of 4096 bytes, resulting in a buffer overflow and a crash (core dump) of
                  sqsh. When readline support was not compiled in, the buffer would be truncated at 4K.
                  Now sqsh uses a flexible input buffer of initial size 16K. When more data is copied into this
                  buffer, it will automatically expand to fit the data.
                  Note, when no readline support is used, the buffer is still limited to 16K, which still might
                  lead to silent truncation.

                             What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.2.0

                                New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature      - You can now define a variable $readline_histignore with a colon separated
                   list of keywords, or a regular expression, that readline should ignore and
                   not store in the readline history list/file. So if you define for example:

    \set readline_histignore='go:lo:mo:exit:quit:vi:!!:GO'
                   or
    \set readline_histignore='"RE:^[glm]o$|^cd |^exit$|^quit$|^vi$"'

                   then these words, when typed on a line by itself, will not be stored in the
                   readline history list and cannot by retrieved with ^P, ^N or cursor up, cursor
                   down keys (in emacs mode, k and j in vi mode). This will reduce the number
                   of key strokes to type when you want to retrieve a previous entered command
                   line. Also the last word of the previous command line will be available
                   under the Meta-_ key in readline. So when you type:

    1> select count(*) from master..sysdatabases
    2> go

                   You only have to type arrow up, or ^P only once to retrieve the previous
                   select statement again, otherwise the "go" command would be displayed
                   first. Second, the Meta-_ key would contain the string master..sysdatabases
                   so you do not have to completely retype the table name. Otherwise the meta
                   character would contain the keyword "go".

    1> select name from <Meta-_>

                   would be sufficient to get:

    1> select name from master..sysdatabases

                   By default the variable $readline_histignore is NULL and all words typed
                   on input will be stored in the readline history. (Depending on
                   $readline_histsize which is 100 by default). Note that when you want to use
                   a regular expression, the string must begin with RE: and the string must be
                   embedded in single quotes and double quotes to prevent early expansion
                   of the string during variable assignment and printing problems if you
                   \echo $readline_histignore because of the pipe characters. The regular
                   expression is evaluated case insensitive, so uppercase GO would also
                   be ignored. See the GNU regex manual for more information on regular
                   expressions.

2 - Feature      - The \bcp command accepts a slicenumber or a partition name to bcp into
                   if the table is partitioned. For example, if you have a semantically list
                   partitioned table on year and a partition name py2013 exists:

    $> sqsh -SPROD -Uadmin_prod -PadminPRDpwd -Dproddb
    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.1> select * from material where year=2013
    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.2> \bcp -SDTA -Uadmin_dta -PadminDTApwd
                              -i"truncate table tstdb..material py2013" tstdb..material:py2013

                   Or when you have a round robin partitioned table and you want to
                   load data into partition slice number 2:

    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.1> select * from cust
    PROD.admin_prod.proddb.2> \bcp -SDTA -Uadmin_dta -PadminDTApwd tstdb..cust:2

                   There is also a new option to the \bcp command, -T, that will disable
                   character set conversion by the client when data transfer from source
                   to target is in progress. When you receive character set conversion
                   errors, you might try this transit option to solve these errors. Otherwise
                   you might set the sqsh and/or \bcp charset parameter identical to the
                   character set of the database server(s), using the -J parameter.
                   As an example sqsh is started using the utf8 character set and connects to
                   an iso_1 database server:

    [mwesdorp@localhost ~]$ sqsh -SJUPITER -Jutf8
    JUPITER.sa.master.1> cd pubs2
    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.1> select * into tempdb..titles from titles where 1=2;
    (0 rows affected)
    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.1> select * from titles
    JUPITER.sa.pubs2.2> \bcp tempdb..titles
    Msg 4847, Level 16, State 1
    Server 'JUPITER', Line 1
    BCP insert operation is disabled when data size is changing between client and server character sets.
    Please use BCP's -Y option to invoke client-side conversion.

    Command has been aborted.

    Open Client Message

                   The first BCP operations fails, while the second BCP operation using the -T
                   option succeeds. The data is just passed on in transit without any
                   character set conversion necessary as both the source and target servers use
                   the same character set.

3 - Feature      - Implementation of semicolon_hack2 to allow for multiple semicolons on one
                   line of input. The semicolons will be used as command separator and act as
                   a \go command for regular SQL statements. So now you can do for example:

    echo "cd master;select name from sysdatabases;select name from syslogins;\echo Done;" | \
    sqsh -SDTA -Lsemicolon_hack2=On

                   When you have both semicolon_hack and semicolon_hack2 enabled, the second
                   one will take precedence. When hack2 is enabled, semicolon_hack may be
                   disabled. Semicolon_hack2 will also use $semicolon_cmd to be executed
                   when a SQL buffer is available for processing.
                   Note that the 'cd' command in this example will execute a use database
                   command. The function is available in the sqshrc-2.2.0 example file in the
                   doc directory.

4 - Feature      - When saving the history buffers, first a merge will be performed with
                   the existing history file if variable histmerge=On, to prevent the loss of
                   history buffers saved by another sqsh session. It happened to me too many
                   times that I had one sqsh session open to do some real work and another
                   session to monitor server status with sp_who, sp_lock, sp_showplan, etc.
                   When I then quit the first session followed by quitting the second session,
                   I then would end up with only a bunch of sp_who, sp_lock statements in
                   my history file as the second sqsh session would have completely overwritten
                   the history file again.
                   As usual this new feature is off by default, so you have to explicitly
                   enable it by specifying \set histmerge=On or set it in in the .sqshrc file.
                   It is also recommended to use histunique=On when you enable histmerge.

                   Note that this can also lead to strange side effects if you have the
                   hist_auto_save option on and another user is logged in with the same
                   Unix/Linux account and is also using sqsh. This is often the case when multiple
                   DBA's ssh into the same sybase account on the database server hostmachine.
                   If your session automatically saves the history buffers after a configured
                   number of changes, then your history may all of a sudden contains the
                   SQL executed by your colleagues as well, as the history of both sessions will
                   be merged eventually. But after all, basically the same might happen with the
                   bash history file in that kind of situation.

5 - Feature      - You can create a TDS trace file and a protocol log file that can be translated
                   with Ribo. When sqsh is build with DEBUG enabled in the Makefile and you enable
                   debugging for TDS with the -lTDS startup flag or execute \set debug=TDS followed
                   by a \reconnect , and the variables debug_tds_logdata and/or debug_tds_capture
                   are set to specify a filename, then CT-library will write extensive logging
                   information.
                   The TDS capture file can be translated with Ribo. To be able to create
                   debug_tds_logdata, sqsh must dynamically link to the Sybase devlib libraries
                   (Add $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/devlib in front of $LD_LIBRARY_PATH),
                   or have been statically linked with these libraries.
                   Note, this option is for administrators who wants to debug Client-Server
                   communication. See Sybase documentation on ct_debug for more information.
                   This features makes use of the ct_debug call that is available from
                   OpenClient and SDK version 12.5.1.

6 - Enhancement  - The \connect (and also \reconnect) command installs a SIGINT signal handler
                   in sqsh-2.2.0. This will prevent memory faults and core dumps when you type
                   ^C during \connect or \reconnect.
                   Also when typing ^C during \reconnect will properly return to the original
                   session. This is handy when the server you are trying to connect to does not
                   respond in a timely manner and you do not want to wait for a login timeout.

7 - Enhancement  - The use of the $datetime variable is improved in a number of locations
                   to strip of [] which is used as a filter to hide %S (seconds) when
                   smalldatetime datatypes are used in result set processing. Also %u for
                   milliseconds will be replaced by "000" were appropriate. A minor bug is fixed
                   in the display routine using the $datetime variable if %u was used. The
                   final result skipped the first character after %u in the format definition.

8 - Enhancement  - New debug choices added for HISTORY (or HIST for short) and TDS.
                   When debugging the ENV subsystem, the printed messages of variable names
                   is improved as it sometimes printed a whole line of a script that contained
                   a variable and that variable was being expanded. In order to use debugging
                   you have to uncomment DEF_DEBUG in the Makefile and start sqsh using the
                   -l parameter or set the $debug variable.

9 - Enhancement  - Hide password processing is improved during sqsh startup. First, the whole
                   argument list is searched for -P parameters and only the last one will be used.
                   In previous versions each -P parameter resulted in the startup of a child
                   process that wrote to a pipe and the parent process re-executed itself in order
                   to read from the pipe and hide it's parameter list from the OS process list.
                   Normally speaking you would only supply the -P parameter once, but in theory
                   you can supply the -P parameter many times on the command line, but only
                   the last one will count.
                   Now only one child process is created (fork) that writes the password to
                   a pipe and the parent process will now wait for the child to finish with a
                   call to waitpid() before it continues to re-execute itself and read from the
                   pipe. This will prevent <defunct> child processes that were not properly
                   administered as finished by the parent process in previous versions of sqsh.

10 - Bug fix     - When you exit from sqsh, sqsh will now perform a normal disconnect from the
                   server you are connected to, and only if that fails it uses a CS_FORCE_CLOSE
                   call to ct_close. The same is true for ct_exit which will use a CS_FORCE_EXIT
                   only if a normal ct_exit fails. By doing this, sqsh will properly notify the
                   server that it is disconnecting, by sending a LOGOUT TDS token.
                   Previous versions only performed a CS_FORCE_CLOSE disconnect, which resulted
                   in not sending a LOGOUT token. I noticed with previous sqsh versions for example,
                   that SAP Sybase IQ 15.4 prints error messages in the server logfile when a
                   session disconnects using the CS_FORCE_CLOSE flag to the ct_close call.

11 - Bug fix     - The \reconnect command will also save the context prior to - and restore
                   the context after a \reconnect failure, as it already did with the connection
                   information. In previous sqsh versions the context was left in an undefined
                   state when a \reconnect to a server failed and the original connection was
                   restored.  That left the connection basically useless and you had to quit sqsh
                   altogether in that situation. Now you can successfully go on with the original
                   session.

12 - Bug fix     - Fixed an encryption bug with the \lock command. The \lock command is used to
                   lock the current sqsh session. Normally speaking a user who is using sqsh in
                   a xterm in a X-Windows environment, would lock the screen to disable
                   unauthorized access when the user stepped away from the computer. But when
                   you start sqsh from a console, you can use the \lock command just to do that.
                   You can assign a password to the variable $lock, that must be typed to
                   unlock a sqsh session that was locked. But you can also use the UNIX password
                   from the login if sqsh was linked with the -lcrypt library.
                   The \lock command will then use the password from /etc/password or
                   /etc/shadow. However, the method to encrypt the typed password to be able to
                   compare it with the stored password was in error. As a consequence the
                   encrypted passwords never matched and thus the session could never be unlocked
                   and it could only be killed.
                   Note that /etc/password and/or /etc/shadow need to be readable by sqsh in
                   order to read the encrypted password.

13 - Bug fix     - Sqsh stores all its variables in a global environment (g_env) that is basically
                   a kind of hash table. In some situations sqsh can start a transactional save-point
                   on this global environment, which means that all changes can be logged and
                   depending on results can be committed or rolled back. So changes to the variable
                   list can be an addition of a new variable, deletion of an existing variable or a
                   modification of the value of a variable. When a variable is queried then sqsh first
                   searches its global environment, and if the variable does not exist there, then
                   it goes to the OS environment to try to obtain the variable from there.
                   When you start sqsh and do not specify a servername with the -S parameter then
                   sqsh will try to obtain the contents of the DSQUERY variable. As this variable does
                   not initially exist in the global environment, it is obtained from the OS
                   environment.
                   When you then tried to \reconnect to another server using \reconnect -S<newserver>
                   then sqsh would create a new global environment variable named DSQUERY within a
                   g_env transaction. When the connection attempt failed, the transaction would be
                   rolled back and the DSQUERY variable should be deleted from the internal
                   environment, so that subsequent DSQUERY searches would go to the OS environment
                   again. However, due to some missing code, the addition of a new variable to g_env
                   was not logged and thus not deleted during the roll back.
                   When the connection attempt failed, then the global DSQUERY variable still
                   contained the name <newserver>. Subsequent DSQUERY lookups would result
                   in <newserver> instead of the contents of the OS environment variable DSQUERY.
                   This would then specify the wrong servername in your prompt for example.

                   When adding new variables during an active save-point, the variable will
                   now be added to the internal log and when the save-point is rolled-back,
                   the variable will now be properly deleted.
                   In sqsh-2.2.0 a number of variables that were initially missing in the global
                   environment are defined there now from the start. This diminishes the probability
                   of strange behavior when sqsh looks up a variable and find it accidentally in the
                   OS environment. These variables are:

                     autouse, debug_tds_logdata, debug_tds_capture, histmerge, readline_histignore,
                     script, semicolon_hack2, tds_version.



14 - Bug fix     - When sqsh was started with the -i parameter to specify a script file,
                   the filename was stored in the ${0} global internal environment, but was
                   never retrieved from there when expanding ${0}. Instead, expanding ${0}
                   resulted in retrieving the name of the sqsh program name from another internal
                   program structure. This is fixed now so that ${0} inside a script file will
                   correctly expand to the script file name or to the function name when sqsh
                   is executing a named function.



15 - Bug fix     - Usage message of \do is improved.
                   Usage message of \hist-load is fixed.
                   Usage message of \hist-save is fixed.



16 - Bug fix     - Using the \read command to assign a value to a variable by redirecting from
                   an input file from the sqshrc or session file was broken. This is now fixed.
                   The corresponding Sourceforge bug report is 1392951.
                   You can now use the following construct in a session (or sqshrc) file:

    \if [ ( "$DSQUERY" = "NEPTUNE" -o "$DSQUERY" = "JUPITER" ) -a "$username" = "sa" ]
        \read password < $HOME/.sqsh/sa_universe.pwd
    \fi
                   So you can connect with: sqsh -SNEPTUNE -Usa for example and the connect
                   procedure will execute the session file and set the correct password from
                   the file.
                   Note that you must supply the full pathname to the input file, otherwise
                   sqsh would try to locate the file in the current directory. That brings me to
                   the next fix in this area: When sqsh was unable to open the file because it
                   does not exist, then sqsh would output: "sqsh: No error".
                   That had to do with the fact that a call to a function to set the error message
                   also used another function call to produce the filename, and that call intervened
                   with the error administration by setting the error code back to zero and thus
                   the \read command was not able to produce the correct error string anymore. Do
                   still follow me? Well, nevertheless, that is also fixed now and correct error
                   messages will be produced with redirected files (both > and <). For example,
                   suppose we want to write to an existing file in /tmp but we do not have
                   permissions to write to that file:

    [101] JUPITER.sa.tempdb.1> sp_who
    [101] JUPITER.sa.tempdb.2> go > /tmp/file_owned_by_root
    sqsh: Unable to open /tmp/file_owned_by_root: sqsh_open: Permission denied

                   Older sqsh versions would produce the "sqsh: No error" message.


17 - Code fix    - Solved a couple of compiler warnings that were generated when using gcc -Wall.
                   Most of them are regarding unused variables, type cast problems, uninitialized
                   variables, etc. See below for a description of the changes per source file.



18 - Enhancement - Last minute change: Added "-J charset", "-A packet_size", "-G tds_version",
                   and "-z language" options to the \connect and \reconnect commands. You can
                   now do "\reconnect -Jutf8" to change the client charset from the default
                   to utf8 without totally stopping and starting sqsh with the -J parameter, for
                   example.


This new version of sqsh has been compiled, linked and tested on Linux Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32 bit,
CentOs 5.9 and 6.4 64 bit, Cygwin on Windows 7, Solaris 10 x86_64 32 and 64 bit and AIX 5.3L 64
bits with Sybase OpenClient 15.7, 15.5, 15.0, 12.5.4 and 12.5.1 and freetds 0.83 and 0.91.
I hope you will enjoy this new version of sqsh as much as I liked developing it.
Cheers, Martin W.

    of keywords that should not be added to the readline history.
    Furthermore solved a couple of compiler warnings regarding typecasts in toupper and
    tolower functions.
  sqsh_readline.c: In function ‘sqsh_readline_init’:
  sqsh_readline.c:129: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘sqsh_exit’
  sqsh_readline.c: At top level:

sqsh-2.2.0/src/sqsh_readline.h
    Function _rl_clear_screen declared.

sqsh-2.2.0/src/var_debug.c
    Added HISTORY (short HIST) and TDS as new debugging areas which can be specified
    with -l or assigned to the $debug variable. Note that sqsh must be build with
    DEBUG enabled in the src/Makefile.

sqsh-2.2.0/src/var.h
    Added new and missing variables to the global general environment. (g_env).



                     What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.1.9

                       New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature     - New -i option to the \bcp command that will enable you to execute
                  a SQL command on the target server just before the bulk copy
                  operation starts. This is very useful to do some initialization
                  on the target server. You could for example truncate the target
                  table first, or run a stored procedure to change the target database
                  options. For example:

    $ sqsh -SPROD -Uworkshop -Pmy5ecret
    1> select * from proddb..materials
    2> \bcp -S DTA -i "truncate table testdb..materials" -N testdb..materials

    Starting copy...
    Batch successfully bulk-copied to SQL Server

    18 rows copied.
    Clock Time (sec.): Total = 0.1250  Avg = 0.0069 (144.00 rows per sec.)


2 - Feature     - Introduce the variables datefmt and timefmt that control how
                  SQL server DATE and TIME datatypes are converted and displayed in
                  the result set. This is similar to the existing datetime datatype
                  conversion routines. By default these variables are set to NULL
                  which means no conversion will be done and the CT-Lib functions
                  will decide how to display the date and time datatype columns.
                  Note, the variables can be preset in the .sqshrc file.
                  For example:

    1> \set datefmt='%d %B %Y'
    1> \set timefmt='%H:%M:%S'
    1> \set datetime='%e %b %Y %H:%M[:%S]'
    1> select convert(date,getdate());
       -----------------
       04 February 2013

    1> select convert(time,getdate());
       --------
       15:20:27

    1> select convert(smalldatetime,getdate())
       ----------------
       4 Feb 2013 15:20


3 - Enhancement - Client-side password encryption is enhanced to be able to
                  use RSA encryption if the OpenClient and ASE server support it.
                  In ASE 15.0.2 a new configuration parameter was introduced,
                  "net password encryption reqd" that can be set to 1 to force
                  clients to use CT-Lib password encryption of the password that
                  is send over the network from the client to the server. Plain
                  passwords are not accepted over the network in that case.
                  If the configuration parameter is set to 2, then the client must
                  even perform stronger RSA password encryption.
                  If the parameter is set to the default value of 0, then no net
                  password encryption is required and the password will be send in
                  plain text to the server if you do not request for encryption when
                  you connect to the server.
                  Sqsh will now use the highest type of encryption possible
                  when the variable $encryption is set to On or 1. You can also start
                  sqsh with the -X option. In sqsh-2.1.9 it is also possible to use
                  the -X option with the \connect or \reconnect commands.
                  The -X option was already present on the \bcp command, but is also
                  enhanced here to use RSA encryption when appropriate.

4 - Enhancement - The \bcp command is made to work with OpenClient and bulk copy
                  library version 15.7.

5 - Bugfix      - When the result set is displayed in CSV format and the data contains
                  a double quote, it is now preceded with an additional double quote.
                  That makes it possible to read the data into a spreadsheet program
                  much more easily.

6 - Bugfix      - Prototype declaration of the readline function unstifle_history
                  changed from "extern void" to "extern int" as some picky
                  compiler settings may complain about a redeclaration of this
                  function from /usr/include/readline/history.h.

7 - Bugfix      - Parsing of the SQSH environment variable for sqsh startup options
                  failed. In particular when options were used that do not require any
                  arguments. For example:

   $ export SQSH="-X -SDTA -b"
   $ sqsh -Usa -P
   sqsh: Options must begin with '-'
   Use: sqsh ....


This version of sqsh has been successfully built and tested on Cygwin 32 bits,
Solaris x86_64, Linux Ubuntu 32bits, Linux CentOS 5.2 64 bits, AIX 5.3L 64 bits.
Also various versions of Readline, Sybase OpenClient (15.7, 15.5) and freetds
(0.83, 0.91) have been used to build and test sqsh-2.1.9. Enjoy!!!

    without a sqshrc file specified.
    Temporary environment variable cur_rcfile removed when finished with sqshrc
    file processing.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/sqsh_readline.h
    Bugfix 6 implementation.

sqsh-2.1.9/src/var.h
    For feature 2, the variables datefmt and timefmt are defined here.
    All variables that are defined to NULL by default, must have the ability
    to be reset back to NULL with \set varname=NULL .
    For those variables that did not have a setting/validation function defined,
    this function is now set to var_set_nullstr.
    Variables that are also stored in specific storage structures (like maxlen,
    datefmt, datetime, bcp_colsep, e.a), along with the g_env environment
    setting, are set to the same default value.

    For example in sqsh-2.1.8:

    1> \set | grep maxlen
    maxlen=NULL
    1> \echo $maxlen
    32768

    In sqsh-2.1.9:

    1> \set | grep maxlen
    maxlen=32768

sqsh-2.1.9/src/var_dsp.c
    Feature 2 (datefmt and timefmt implementation)



                     What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.1.8

                       New features, enhancements, bug fixes:

1 - Feature     - Dynamic load of keyword list for Readline keyword completion.
	Until now you were only able to use a fixed list of keywords that were
	provided in a file through the "$keyword_file" variable.
	Now you can enable the variable "$keyword_dynamic" and provide a query
	using the variable "$keyword_query" that will be executed each time you
	log in to a server or change database context using the "use <dbname>"
	command. This feature will only work in Sybase ASE and MSSQL servers.

	The default query provided with "$keyword_query" is:

		"select name from sysobjects order by name"

	But you can provide your own query, as long as the first column in
	the result set returns a character datatype string. For example:

          \set keyword_query="\\
            select name from sysobjects \\
            where type in ('U','V','P','S') \\
            union \\
            select name from sybsystemprocs..sysobjects \\
            where type='P' \\
            order by name"

	I have used this feature in an environment with more than 5000 objects
	loaded in the completion list each time the database context was
	changed, and I did not notice any performance degradation while
	switching from database to database or while using the Readline TAB
	completion feature.

	The second part of this feature automatically completes column names
	when you type an object name followed by a dot and then use Readline
	TAB completion. For example, if you type
	1> ....
	2> where syslogins.<TAB>
	then sqsh will show all columns of syslogins that you can auto-complete
	even further by the Readline module. Of course this will only work for
	objects in the current database. Furthermore, the object does not have
	to exist in the keyword completion list itself. These two feature
	parts work independently of each other, as long as keyword_dynamic and
	keyword_completion are enabled.

	Note 1: Readline auto-completion uses a TAB, or TAB TAB, or sometimes
	ESC ESC. It works in sqsh the same way as you use auto-completion of
	filenames in your shell. Settings are controlled in ~/.inputrc or global
	/etc inputrc settings. See the GNU Readline library documentation for
	more info on auto-completion.

	Note 2: In sqsh-2.1.8/doc a file sqshrc-2.1.8 is provided that contains
	appropriate settings for the newest features in sqsh. Note that the
	color prompt settings in this file are optimized for a (xterm) window
	with white background color. Copy this file to ~/.sqshrc and make sure
	you have a directory ~/.sqsh and you are completely ready to use sqsh
	in its full glory.


2 - Enhancement - Check on running background jobs or pending job output before
	exiting sqsh. If you have running jobs in the background that were
	started with "go &", in sqsh-2.1.7 an exit or quit of the parent process
	would also kill the child processes. Now a check is performed to see if
	there are running jobs or finished jobs with pending output. If this is
	the case then a message is displayed:

		"You have running jobs or pending job output"

	In order to exit sqsh anyway, you have to kill your jobs (\kill)
	manually and process pending output (\show) first.


3 - Enhancement - Tilde expansion on command line.
	If you are used to use a ~ in shell commands that will be expanded to
	your HOME directory name, then you can now use them in sqsh as well.
	The tilde will only be expanded in sqsh commands (and their aliases)
	like the "\go" command, not in the SQL buffer.
	For example:

	...
	3> go -m bcp > ~/bcp_format.dat

	Note that this will only work if GNU Readline is compiled into sqsh.


4 - Enhancement - Password retry loop for MSSQL, DCO/ECDA and Sybase Repserver
	connections added.
	If you tried to logon to any other server than Sybase ASE, IQ or ASA
	and you provided the wrong password, then sqsh terminated immediately
	with an error message. Now you get the chance to retype the password
	again and again until you are successfully logged in, provided that
	$password_retry is enabled (and the server does not lock you out after
	an x number of login attempts).


5 - Bug fix     - Improved processing in displaying binary or image data and
	fixed a bug when querying column sysprocesses.sid in MSSQL, which
	resulted in a buffer overflow error.
	Bug report ID: 3079678


6 - Bug fix     - Unable to use "-P -" to provide a password on stdin.
	Bug report ID: 3388213

7 - Bug fix	- Nested \if statements did not work

	\set x=''
	\if [ -z ${x} ]
	        \echo "Level 1: EMPTY -${x}-"
	        \set x='a'
	        \if [ -z ${x} ]
	                \echo "Level 2: EMPTY -${x}-"
	        \else
	                \echo "Level 2: NOT EMPTY -${x}-"
	        \fi
	\else
	        \echo "Level 1: NOT EMPTY -${x}-"
	\fi

	This script executed in sqsh-2.1.7 would produce the incorrect results:

	Level 1: EMPTY --
	Level 2: EMPTY -a-
	Level 2: NOT EMPTY -a-

	This is now fixed in sqsh-2.1.8 and the correct results are produced now:

	Level 1: EMPTY --
	Level 2: NOT EMPTY -a-


This version of sqsh has been successfully built and tested on Cygwin 32 bits,
Solaris x86_64, Linux Ubuntu 32bits, Linux CentOS 5.2 64 bits, AIX 5.3L 64 bits.
Also various versions of Readline, Sybase OpenClient (15.5, 15.0) and freetds
(0.83, 0.91) have been used to build and test sqsh-2.1.8.
I hope you enjoy and love this new version of sqsh as much as I do.



                Changed files in sqsh-2.1.8

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_connect.c
	Implements feature 1), by setting an internal variable $keyword_refresh
	to 1 in case a Msg 5701 is determined, meaning that a change of
	database occurred or an initial login. The variables denotes that the
	keyword list should be refreshed in the cmd_input loop.

	Also implements enhancement 4), by repeatedly asking for a password in
	case a wrong password was supplied for connections to MSSQL, Sybase
	ECDA/DCO and or Sybase RepServer. Originally this only worked for
	connections to Sybase ASE, IQ and ASA.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_exit.c
	Implements enhancement 2), by checking if child jobs are running or if
	pending job output is waiting for retrieval. If this is the case then a
	message is presented: "You have running jobs or pending job output".
	This is to prevent unintentionally killing child processes if you exit
	the parent sqsh session. If you still want to exit your parent session
	you have to kill all your child jobs first.

	Query running/finished jobs: \jobs [-i]
	Kill running jobs:           \kill <jobnr>
	Show output:                 \show <jobnr> > /dev/null
	Wait for jobs to finish:     \wait ...

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_if.c
	Implements a fix for bug report 7).
	While parsing an \if statement the body of the if and else branch are
	copied to a buffer for subsequent body execution, depending on the
	evaluation of the \if statement. When a nested \if statement was
	discovered, the nestlevel was increased but the \if statement itself not
	copied to this buffer. With this fix, the if and else branch will now
	contain the nested \if statements and will successfully execute.
	Also the evaluationvalue of the \if statement (true or false) will now
	be available in the ${?} variable.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/cmd_input.c
	Implements feature 1), by executing a query to refresh the Readline
	auto-completion keyword list when a change of database occurred. This
	is triggered by a variable "$keyword_refresh" that will be set in
	cmd_connect.c by the callback handler in case a "use <database>"
	statement was executed.
	The query that will be run is provided in the variable $keyword_query.
	The default query is: "select name from sysobjects order by name". But
	you can change that in the .sqshrc file for your own convenience to:

	  \set keyword_query="\\
	    select name from sysobjects \\
	    where type in ('U','V','P','S') \\
	    union \\
	    select name from sybsystemprocs..sysobjects \\
	    where type='P' \\
	    order by name"

	for example. If you type a TAB while entering text, Readline will
	search the keyword list for possible completions and presents them or
	just completes the word you were typing if there is only one possibility
	left.
	This feature is enabled or disabled by the variable "$keyword_dynamic".
	The default is "Off", so you have to explicitly set the variable to "On"
	if you want to take advantage of this new feature. Also the variable
	"$keyword_completion" needs to be set with a value greater than zero.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/dsp_desc.c
	Bugfix 5): Improved handling of binary and image datatypes.
	Fix bugreport 3079678.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_buf.c
	Some preprocessing code is moved to sqsh_readline.h for better include
	file handling.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_config.h
	Defines a default value that will be assigned to $keyword_query.
	  "select name from sysobjects order by name"
	Also sets SQSH_VERSION to the string "sqsh-2.1.8".

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_global.c
	Changed copyright string.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_job.c
	Implements enhancement 3), tilde expansion on the command line. If you
	type:

	1> select name from syslogins
	2> go | grep sa_ > ~/tmp/sa_logins.out

	for example, the tilde will be replaced with your home directory. You
	can use any valid ~name that can be expanded to the corresponding home
	directory of the specified login name, for example ~sybase. Note that
	other expansions like ~+ for $PWD or ~- for $OLDPWD will not work in
	sqsh, as it does in the Bash shell. You will need Readline compiled in
	to use this feature (./configure --with-readline ...)

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_main.c
	Implemented a fix for passing on passwords through stdin with -P -
	Fix for bug 6).

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_readline.c
	Implements feature 1), dynamic column name expansions when you type
	a TAB (or double TAB) after an object name followed by a dot.
	For example type: select sysprocesses.<TAB> ...then sqsh will show you
	all the available column names of the sysprocesses table, provided that
	you are in the master database of course. So the object must exist in
	the current database. This feature will only work if variables
	"$keyword_dynamic" and $keyword_completion are enabled.
	Also all the reserved keywords in ASE 15.7 that were not already on the
	list, are added to the default keyword completion list. This list will
	be used if you do not provide your own list through the "$keyword_file"
	variable and "$keyword_dynamic" is disabled. Again, you will have to
	compile GNU Readline in sqsh to be able to use this feature.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/sqsh_readline.h
	Moved some of the prototypes and include file definitions from some C
	source files to this local include file.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/var.h
	Replaced the hardcoded sqsh appname by the preprocessor variable
	SQSH_VERSION. This variable is defined in sqsh_config.h and set to
	the string sqsh-2.1.8.

sqsh-2.1.8/src/var_readline.c
	Removed some of the prototypes and the inclusion of
	<readline/readline.h> here and replaced them with an include of
	"sqsh_readline.h".



		What is new or fixed in version sqsh-2.1.7

				New features:

1 - Command \exit accepts a return code (Solution to feature request 1954395).
    You can now exit sqsh with an exit code. For example:

    [1] SYBASE.sa.master 1> quit 5
    ~> echo $?
    5

    This feature uses a new sqsh variable $exit_value (int) which can be
    explicitly set using: \set exit_value=n
    or you can use \exit x, (and its aliased counterparts like quit and exit).
    The value must be of type integer, greater equal 0. (Most shells only
    supports exit values up to 255, and it is your own responsibility to use
    exit codes your shell can handle.)
    When sqsh is going to terminate, it checks the value of $exit_value,
    and when non-zero, it uses this value as exit code. Is $exit_value equal
    to zero, then sqsh reverts to standard behavior. That is, it will check
    variable $exit_failcount and when 1, it will use the value of
    $batch_failcount as exit code. So basically $exit_value takes precedence
    over $exit_failcount and $batch_failcount.

2 - A new variable $xwin_title (string) is introduced to assign a name to an
    X-windows result set window. (Solution to feature request 1027627).

    You can assign a string to the variable $xwin_title using:

    \set xwin_title='$DSQUERY result set $histnum'

    Note, You can set this as a default name in your .sqshrc file.
    There is also a new option -T to the \go and \rpc commands to temporarily
    assign another name string to $xwin_title. For example:

    [1] SYBASE.sa.master 1> exec sp_who
    [1] SYBASE.sa.master 2> \go -x -T"What is running on server $DSQUERY"

    The string value will be used to assign a name to the window. Of course the
    option -T is only useful in combination with the -x option. After that, the
    original $xwin_title value will be restored.
    The feature works for Motif widgets as well as for X/Athena widgets. When
    you do not set the $xwin_title variable in your sqsh session and do not use
    the -T option along with the -x option, then the name of the created result
    set window will default to "main".

2b- When using the -x option with the \rpc command and Motif is used, the rpc
    command is now shown in the SQL pane. As a consequence the SQL buffer is
    now cleared and not saved in the history when a \rpc command is issued.

3 - A new variable $term_title (string) is introduced. When set, sqsh will
    alter the name of the xterm window when started up. For example:

    \set term_title='$DSQUERY ($hostname)'

    Sqsh will prepend the title string with its startup name (argv[0]
    parameter). For example: "sqsh SYBPROD1 (ux-prd-5)"
    This feature is very useful when you have multiple xterm/sqsh sessions
    running connected to different servers. It will be easier to identify
    your sessions on the Window Manager's task bar. When sqsh exits normally,
    the window title is wiped out. The feature also works for rxvt type windows,
    Putty and even Microsoft Windows MS-DOS COMMAND.com and CMD.exe windows,
    when using a Cygwin build of sqsh. (Do not use $term_title on a console.)
    Often the Shell will also set a window title with the connection name and
    path. In bash for example, you can set variable PROMPT_COMMAND in the
    .bashrc file, like:

    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD/$HOME/~}\007"'

    So when you exit sqsh, the window title might be changed by the shell to
    "sybase@ux-prd-5:/opt/sybase"

4a- The command history will now keep track of the date and time of the last
    access of a history buffer. Also the usage count of a buffer is tracked.
    The latter is especially useful if you use the sqsh-2.1.6 histunique
    feature. You can retrieve the additional information on buffers by
    specifying a new parameter -i to the \history command. For example:

    The first number is the number of the history buffer. The second number is a
    count of executions of the buffer. (This is not necessarily true as you can
    also \reset a buffer without executing it, but still will be stored in the
    history list (see 6)). The third item in the info list is the date and time
    of the last buffer access. The remaining part is the content of the buffer
    itself. You can influence the display format of the date and time by setting
    the variable $datetime to a strftime format string.

    [19] SATURN.sa.master.1> \echo $datetime
    %e %b %Y %H:%M:%S
    [19] SATURN.sa.master.1> select getdate()
    [19] SATURN.sa.master.2> go

     --------------------
      9 Jan 2010 19:46:56

    (1 row affected)

    The contents of $datetime also has impact on how datetime columns will be
    shown in sqsh. When set to default, sqsh will show datetime columns as:

    [19] SATURN.sa.master.1> \set datetime='default'
    [19] SATURN.sa.master.1> \echo $datetime
    default
    [19] SATURN.sa.master.1> select getdate()
    [19] SATURN.sa.master.2> go

     -------------------
     Jan  9 2010  7:48PM


    The extra information on buffer access time and usage count will also be
    stored and retrieved in the history files. When you start sqsh-2.1.7 for
    the first time using existing history data, the date will be set to 1 jan
    1970 and a usage count to 1. When you open a sqsh-2.1.7 format history file
    in an older version of sqsh, you will notice an extra line in the buffer
    data:

    --> History Info (1263053091:12) <--

    for example. The line itself will be interpreted as a SQL comment, so has no
    effect on buffer execution and will be saved again upon exit, so no data
    is lost and the history can be loaded again in sqsh-2.1.7 as normal.

4c- There is also a new parameter -x to the \history command to specify a number
    of most recent command buffers to show. For example "\history -x 5" will
    only show the 5 most recent buffers. An alias defined as
    "\alias \hi='\history -i -x20'" will show the 20 most recent buffers with
    full info displayed when you execute the \hi command.

4d- Buffers only containing blanks, newlines, tabs etc, will not be added to
    the history list when the buffer is reset (using the \reset command).

5 - Ignore Ctrl-\ (SIGQUIT) signals to prevent accidental termination of sqsh
    with a stack trace when running in interactive mode.

6 - A new command \clear is implemented as a companion of the \reset command.
    Where \reset writes the current buffer to the history list before flushing
    the buffer, \clear only empties the buffer, without writing to the
    history. Also, when readline is compiled in, the screen is cleared, as ^l
    does. The \clear command is also aliased to 'clear'.

7 - A new read only variable $$ is introduced to show the sqsh host process id.
    Use "\echo $$" or "\echo ${$}" to show the process id, which should be the
    same as the value of the master.dbo.sysprocesses.hostprocess column for the
    current spid when connected to Sybase ASE from a Unix host. I.e.:

    select hostprocess from master..sysprocesses where spid=@@spid;

8 - A new command \hist-save is introduced to save the complete history to the
    current $history file, or save it to a new file specified in the
    "\hist-save [filename]" command. Also a new command \hist-load will load
    a history file and append it to the current list of history buffers:
    "hist-load [filename]". If no filename is specified the file in variable
    $history will be used to load from.

9 - A new variable $hist_auto_save (int) is introduced. When the history is
    changed more often than the value of this variable, the history is
    automatically saved to the current $history file. This prevents that you
    potentially lose a lot of history data when your sqsh session crashes
    unexpectedly.

10- The \buf-del command introduced in sqsh-2.1.6 now accepts a range
    specification of buffers to delete. For example "\buf-del 1-10" will delete
    the first 10 history buffers. No result messages will be written anymore.
    Be warned that the buffers may get re-numbered when you delete one or
    more buffers from the history.

11- The $session variable will now be expanded so it may contain variables
    itself. E.g.: \set session=$HOME/.sqsh/.session_${DSQUERY}

12- Improved TDS version request handling when using startup option -G.
    Besides the versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.6, 4.9.5 and 5.0, also versions 7.0
    and 8.0 are recognized when compiling sqsh with freetds-0.82. When you
    request a specific TDS version, the variable $tds_version will be defined
    and when that variable exists, sqsh will obtain the actual TDS version in
    effect when the connection is established, and put that value back into the
    $tds_version variable. So it may be that you request version 4.2, but still
    get version 4.0, depending on the client-server capabilities.
    Note that sqsh will not perform any input validation on the input of the -G
    parameter. So when you specify an invalid value, the default version of 5.0
    will be used without any warning. Normally speaking you do not need to
    specify a TDS version (Tabular Data Stream, a Sybase and Microsoft protocol
    used in client-server communication). The option -G can be useful to test
    client-server capabilities, especially when using freetds.

13- Improved network authentication handling. Introduced a new command \snace
    to report the session expiration interval for a network authenticated
    session.
    Support for delegation (CS_SEC_DELEGATION) security service added.

14- The \go command now accepts comments on the command line in C-Style
    notation /* */ and the ANSI SQL comment syntax: --
    The comment tokens must be enclosed in white space: /*This will not work*/
    /* This is OK */
    The -- comments will ignore everything up to End of Line.
    With this new feature it is now possible to run Sybase installation scripts
    that use constructions like: go	/* } */
    or: go	-- }


			Bug fixes in sqsh-2.1.7

1 - Successive \bcp operation may fail because of binding issues in bulk copy
    library operations. Solved by using calloc instead of malloc when
    allocating buffers for bulkcopy transfer.
    (Corresponding bug report: 2920048)

2 - Fix for bug report 1959260 supplied by Stephen Doherty. When using
    '\go -m bcp' a bcp out of a non-null char(1) or varchar() column with
    only blank data, should produce a blank in the output, irrespective of the
    $bcp_trim setting, in order to prevent subsequent bulk copy in errors.

3 - Resizing the X windows result set window (go -x) with Motif widgets, only
    resized the "Done" button. This is being fixed now with patch 1290313 by
    John Griffin.

4 - When using X/Athena widgets for \go -x, always create scrollbars for the
    result windows. (X11 without Motif).

5 - When using an output file with the -o option, stderr messages where not
    captured in the output file but written to the terminal/xterm/tty.
    If the output file already existed, it was not truncated when opened. So
    it could happen that the output file still contained data from a previous
    sqsh run when the output data produced in the last run was less then
    that of the first run and thus the file was not totally overwritten.

6 - Fixed a problem with the password hiding feature. (Solution to feature
    request 1577984, bug report 1487118 and patch 2607434). Courtesy of
    David Wood.

7 - Fixed a problem with the default initialization of sqsh variables
    $histunique and $ignoreeof. (Corresponding bug report 2871368)

8 - Switching the variable $bcp_trim from off to on failed. Part of patch
    2061950 (thanks to Klaus-Martin Hansche) fixed this issue.

9 - The usage message of \go did lack a description of the -p option.
    This one is added now.

10- When creating a result set using the vertical display option (\go -m vert)
    it could happen that if a non-null column received no data (caused by
    data corruption or TDS protocol errors), the next column would be printed
    on the same line. If no column data is received, a newline is now always
    outputted.
    In the same module fixed a minor error: when the column data exceeds the
    screen width and has to wrap onto the next line, the indentation alignment
    came 1 blank short. Is also fixed now.

11- In the background jobs area a lot of improvements are implemented making
    running background processes (\go &) in sqsh-2.1.7 much more reliable.

a)  When two or more batch jobs where started in the background, the deferred
    output files from already running jobs were removed. For example:

    1> dbcc checkdb (order_prod)
    2> go &
    Job #1 running [349]
    1> dbcc checkdb (cust_prod)
    2> go &
    Job #2 running [763]

    When using $defer_bg = 1, a deferred output file will be created for each
    individual job. However, a cleanup procedure executed during the startup of
    the child process accidentally unlinked output files of already running
    brother and sister processes.

b)  The batch was not saved in the history. So the dbcc commands in the previous
    example would not be saved in the history buffers.

c)  SIGCHLD signals were not always handled by the designated signal handler.
    As a consequence, the batches were never reported finished and output could
    not be shown with the \show command.

d)  The batch related command \jobs now accepts an option -i to show additional
    information on the jobs. Also input parameters for \show and \wait
    are checked for correctness. Erroneous parameters could otherwise produce
    floating point exceptions or other unexpected results.

    As an example, take a look at the next sqsh-2.1.6 session:

    ~> sqsh-2.1.6 -SNEPTUNE
    1> \echo "This sqsh version $version is not background job reliable" &
    Job #1 running [12472]
    1> \jobs
    Job #1: 30-Jan-10 13:11:16 (5 secs)
    1> \wait 1
    \wait: Object does not exist
    1> \show 1
    \show: Job 1 has not completed
    1> \wait -1
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)

    Although the child process is finished, it is not correctly signaled, so we
    do not get a notification that the job is finished. When we try a "\wait 1",
    the job cannot be found and "\show 1" claims the job is not finished yet.
    When we finally try a "\wait -1" sqsh terminates with a segmentation fault.
    The same session in sqsh-2.1.7:

    ~> sqsh-2.1.7 -SNEPTUNE
    1> \echo "This sqsh version $version is background job reliable" &
    Job #1 running [16448]
    1> \jobs
    Job #1: 30-Jan-10 13:17:59 (1 secs)
    Job #1 complete (output pending)
    1> \wait 1
    Job #1 complete (output pending)
    1> \wait -1
    \wait: No jobs pending
    1> \show 1
    This sqsh version sqsh-2.1.7 is background job reliable

12- When sqsh is started with additional parameters to be passed on to the
    -i input script, parameters ${#} and ${*} were not properly set and
    references to ${0} in interactive mode produced segmentation faults.
    Also the $* parameter which should produce a list of all parameters was
    not correctly displayed. For example, the contents of an input script named
    example.sqsh:

    \echo $#
    \echo $*
    \echo ${0} ${1} ${2} ${3} ${4}

    sqsh -SDBPRD1 -Usa -i example.sqsh a b -Psecret c

    Should now correctly produce:

    3
    a b c
    sqsh a b c

13- When executing a SQL command with \go -x while no X11 support was compiled
    into sqsh, the result buffer of the query would not be canceled. This led to
    errors in subsequent batches. Fixed by returning a DSP_FAIL instead of
    DSP_SUCCEED after the error message was printed.

14- When specifying a new cmdend alias for the \go command, the alias was just
    defined in the wrong direction. For example "sqsh ... -cGO" would define an
    alias \go for the GO command. So when you entered GO, nothing happened as it
    was not recognized as a sqsh command. When executing \go, an error was
    generated because sqsh now tried to find the internal command GO which does
    not exist. The definition of the alias must be reversed, i.e. GO is an alias
    for the \go command, so when you enter GO, sqsh will execute \go.

15- When using sqsh build for Motif and you run a query with "\go -x", sqsh
    would create a X window with an unlimited size for the SQL batch section.
    If you have a large batch, this could eat up all the windows space and no
    space left to show the results.
    The SQL batch window is now limited to 10 rows and you have to scroll the
    window section to see the rest of the batch.

16- When a connection is killed or a server performs a shutdown, the connection
    to the server is lost. This will eventually be detected by sqsh and a client
    callback handler will call sqsh_exit. However, the callback handler did not
    return a CS_FAIL or CS_SUCCEED, so CS/CT-lib thinks the callback handler
    is still active and produces a warning message that the client did not
    exited from CT-lib, when the context is dropped.
    The callback handler will now return value 254 (abort) and sqsh_exit will
    not try to drop the CS/CT-lib context in this case.
    Also in very rare circumstances sqsh_exit could be called recursively,
    resulting in a segment violation as pointers to destroyed memory structures
    were not nullified.

17- Implemented fix 1289922 by John Griffin to prevent unexpected sqsh shutdown
    on Solaris when child process terminates.

	command. Changed some of the error messages. (Changed \go to \rpc).
	When a Motif X-Windows result set is generated, the rpc command is
	also shown in the SQL pane. The cmd_rpc function returns CMD_CLEARBUF
	to clear and disgard the current SQL buffer. The previous versions
	returned CMD_RESETBUF to add the SQL buffer to the history. However,
	sqsh now 'abuses' the SQL buffer to pass on the \rpc command to the

	Values were out of sync with corresponding message numbers in
	error message table sg_sqsh_errtable. Fortunately due to the way
	the messages were used, would probably never lead to a real problem.

sqsh_init.c
	F3. Reset windows title ($term_title) upon exit.
	Use g_interactive to determine if history must be saved and readline
	functions cleaned up.
	B16: prevent segmentation violations with recursive calls to sqsh_exit
	by nullifying pointers to destroyed memory structures. Always call
	ct_close even if the connection is dead.
	Do not call cs_ctx_drop to drop the context when a connection was lost
	due to a server shutdown, a killed session or network issues. This
	prevents message:
	  CS-Library error: severity(1) layer(2) origin(1) number(31)
	  cs_ctx_drop: cslib user api layer: external error:
	  The context structure cannot be dropped because the application has

	interactive mode.
	F5. Ignore SIGQUIT signals in interactive mode.
	B14. Fix handling of -c cmdend aliases for the \go command.

var.h
	Variable $appname changed from sqsh-2.1.6 to sqsh-2.1.7
	B7. $histunique and $ignoreeof initialized to 0 instead of 'Off'.
	F1, F2, F3, F9. New variables $exit_value, $xwin_title, $term_title
	and $hist_auto_save defined.

var_dsp.c
	B8. Fix problem when switching variable $bcp_trim from Off to On.

				Notes

1) If you have background jobs running and you issue a Ctrl-C in your current
running foreground task, to interrupt processing, be aware that the SIGINT
signal is also sent to the child processes, and that they will terminate
as well. Although the child process resets all its signals with sig_restore,
and asks to ignore SIGINT interrupts at interrupt stack level 0 during startup,
the process will still setup (a) SIGINT handler(s) itself, before actively
running a SQL batch, just as the parent does. So when a SIGINT interrupt
arrives, the child will respond accordingly, which means stop processing in
99% of the cases. So be careful with Ctrl-C when running background jobs.

If you have multiple background jobs running and perform a "\wait <job_id>" on
a specific job, you may have to do a specific "\wait <job_id>" or multiple
"\wait -1" commands as well to get signaling information for the other
processes, if they have finished during the time period of the first executed
\wait. The explicit wait for a specific job/pid will temporarily disable the
signal handler for SIGCHLD events. If other child processes terminate during
this period, their signals will be suspended, until they are picked up by a
waitpid which will be issued by the \wait command.


2) Sessions that uses LDAP or Kerberos user authentication should be able to
use background jobs. During testing of Kerberos connections, I came across the
situation that the name of the security mechanism in the libtcl.cfg file was
specified in uppercase "CSFKRB5" while the name of the secmech in the
$SYBASE/config/objectid.dat file is "csfkrb5".
When you just specify -Z or -Zdefault to setup a secure connection, you leave
it up to OpenClient to select the appropriate secmech. So OpenClient will pick
the first available entry, "CSFKRB5".
During session establishment sqsh request the real name of the security
mechanism being used, and that one is the secmech name from the objectid.dat
file. That name is put in the sqsh variable $secmech.
So the real secmech is stored in $secmech, and that is also the variable used
for the security mechanism specified during \reconnect. When this secmech name
is different from the libtcl.cfg security entry, it cannot be found during
\reconnect, and the login fails. Using the same name with the same case in
the libtcl.cfg file for your desired security mechanism as in objectid.dat
(csfkrb5) will solve this issue.


3) Connections that use SSL/TLS should also be able to use background jobs.
When a login trigger checks if a login is already connected and does not allow
multiple connections for the same login, for example, then the background job
feature will not work.


4) Build and run tests:
- Sqsh-2.1.7 successfully built and tested on Windows-XP with Cygwin 1.7.1-1
  and Sybase OpenClient 15.0 EBF17012 ESD #19. (32bit)
- On the same platform sqsh-2.1.7 also successfully builds and runs using
  freetds-0.82 instead of Sybase OpenClient.
  Note, do not use \bcp operations with freetds as unexpected results
  and even database corruption may occur. Use the sqsh "go -m bcp" option to
  create a bulkcopy file and use the freebcp utility to bulk copy in, instead.

  Sybase CTISQL Utility/15.5/P/DRV.15.5.0/i386/Solaris 10/BUILD1550-003/OPT/


5) sqsh-2.1.7 was successfully tested connecting to Sybase ASE 15.5, 15.0.x,
IQ 12.7, IQ 15.1, RepServer 15.2 all on Windows XP and Linux, 32 bits.
The freetds version also successfully connects to Microsoft SQL server 2005.
The sqsh -X option or $encryption=On variable setting will not work with Sybase
IQ.


6) I found out during code inspections that there is an undocumented variable
${$?}. The variable contains the result of the last executed \if statement.
The \if statement would be run as a child process running the 'test' command.
The result can be 0 for False, 1 for True or 2 means some error occurred
(test expression syntax error for example). I wonder if the usage of the "$?"
parameter name was chosen on purpose or was a small coding mistake and was
meant to be just "?". Well it does not hurt to keep it this way, as long as you
are aware that conditional statements do not set variable "?" as a normal shell
would.


7) Be aware that freetds does not support all datatypes Sybase ASE supports,
like the DATE and TIME datatypes (4 byte size). When you have a table with a
DATE or TIME column and query the table using freetds, the data will be
presented as a datetime datatype (8 bytes). So consider the next example:

1> create table freetds (id INT NOT NULL, insdate DATE NOT NULL)
2> go
1> insert freetds values (1, getdate())
2> go
(1 row affected)
1> select * from freetds
2> go
 id          insdate
 ----------- --------------------
           1 31 Jan 2010 00:00:00

(1 row affected)

When reconnecting with a Sybase OCS capable version of sqsh the query result is:

1> select * from freetds
2> go
 id          insdate
 ----------- -----------
           1 Jan 31 2010

(1 row affected)

When you select the data using the bcp output format and write it to a file
(using the freetds version of sqsh again):

1> select * from freetds
2> go -m bcp > freetds.dat

The contents of the file are: "1#31 Jan 2010 00:00:00". (The # is the column
separator.) When you try to bcp this data back into the table using freetds,
it assumes the datatype is a 8 bytes datetime datatype. However, the real
datatype is a 4 byte DATE datatype. When you are lucky, the server will
detect the error, but it may lead to data corruption as well when loading
larger blocks of data, especially when using the \bcp command directly.

MSSQL 2005 only supports DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME datatypes. When using these
datatypes there should be no problem in using \bcp.


8) Job runtime issues of background jobs. When you run a job in the background
its starttime is stored in the job memory structure. Besides a list of job
structures, sqsh maintains a list of running child pids. When you execute \jobs
to see which jobs exists, the job runtime is calculated from the current
system time. However, when the child process finishes, it is registered as
complete by the signal handler in the pid list only. The job structure is not
modified immediately. It is the read-eval-print loop of sqsh that polls the
status of running jobs, and when found that a child process is finished, the
corresponding job is marked complete and its end time marked. This means if you
do not press enter on the sqsh command line regularly, the waittime accumulates
in the total job run time. To solve this, the signal handler should keep track
of the process end time, that can then be used by the job handler.
Basically, if \jobs report a job (done - x secs), the time is the difference
of the job start time and the job completion notification, not the real run
time of the background process.



                    What is new in version sqsh 2.1.6.

1) Color support for prompt and text, using color specification
   in the definition of the prompt and prompt2 variables.

   Color codes are presented in a string such as: {1;2;3}. If sqsh encounters a {
   in the prompt string it will assume a colorcode is supplied and will act
   as such. No checks will be performed on the validity of the colorcode
   definition itself. The color definition consists of three values separated by
   a semicolon.
   The first code defines the Color Attribute Code with possible values:
     00=none 01=bold
   The second value defines the Text Color Code:
     30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
   The third value defines the Background Color Code:
     40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
   The last colorcode for the background may be ommitted.

   Not all color and attribute combinations will present good results, depending
   on your terminal type and color scheme. But the following values work right
   for me on a xterm with a creamy white background color in Linux as well as
   rxvt in Cygwin with a black background window:
   Prompt: Blue text in white background "{0;34;47}"
   Command text: Yellow text             "{0;33}"

   sqsh will translate the colorcodes to an actual colorcode string that
   is presented to readline: for example "\001\033[0;36;47m\002"
   Note that if you want to use curly brackets in your prompt, you have to
   escape colorization by specifying a double brace, like {{...}}. For example:

   \set prompt_color='{0;34;47}'
   \set text_color='{0;33}'
   \set prompt='$prompt_color{{$DSQUERY.$username.$database.$lineno}}>$text_color '

   Note, colorsupport is only available if sqsh is compiled and linked with readline
   support enabled (./configure --with-readline).

2) History unique support using the histunique boolean variable. Can be set in
   the sqshrc file or on the fly with the \set command. When turned on, sqsh
   maintains a MRU-LRU order of executed buffers and does not store duplicate
   command buffers. For example, observe the following situation:

   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> \h
   (1) sp_who
   (2) grant role mon_role to sa_role
   (3) select * from monProcessActivity
   (4) select @@authmech,show_sec_services()
   (5) select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services()
   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> sp_who
   LINUX1502.user1.master.2> go
   ... output ommitted
   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> \h
   (1) grant role mon_role to sa_role
   (2) select * from monProcessActivity
   (3) select @@authmech,show_sec_services()
   (4) select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services()
   (5) sp_who

   sp_who is the last executed command and the buffer - originally the last in the list -
   is now on top of the list.

   Equalness of buffers is determined by means of a checksum calculated on the contents
   of the buffer. If you change only one byte (add or remove a blank for example), the
   new buffer compared to the old buffer will be considered different.

3) Addition of \buf-del command to remove history buffers from the
   history list, because you do not want them to be stored on disk
   when you exit sqsh, or if the buffers are taking up unnessecary
   space when you are developing and constantly changing some SQL
   statement. For example:

   ASE1502.sa.master.1> \history
   (1) exec sp_password myPforSA,NewPforU, user1
   (2) sp_displaylogin user1
   (3) ....

   If you want buffer 1 removed, you can type:

   ASE1502.sa.master.1> \buf-del 1
   Buffer 1 destroyed and list renumbered

4) Variable ignoreeof determines what happens when ^d is typed on an empty line
   when readline support is enabled. By default, sqsh is terminated. When the
   option is turned on (using the sqshrc file), a message is shown when you type
   CTRL-D: Use "exit" or "quit" to leave the sqsh shell.
   This is quite similar to setting "set -o ignoreeof" in the bash shell.

5) Login and query timeout values can be specified using the variables login_timeout
   and query_timeout versus the command line parameters -T and -Q. These are equivalent
   to the isql options -l for login timeout and -t for query timeout. By default the
   variables are defined NULL, meaning the old behaviour of sqsh. But you can specify
   a default value for login timeout of 60 seconds in sqshrc to get identical behaviour
   as isql provides: \set login_timeout=60

   For example trying to connect to a server that is not started:

   sqsh -SSYBIQ -UDBA -PSQL -T5
   Open Client Message
   Layer 1, Origin 2, Severity 2, Number 63
   ct_connect(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.
   SYBIQ: Login timeout detected, aborting connection attempt

   Running a query that results in a table scan and does not return
   within 30 seconds:

   sqsh -SASE1502 -Usa -P -Q30
   ASE1502.sa.master.1> cd tix
   ASE1502.sa.tix.1> select count(*) from E_TIX;
   Open Client Message
   Layer 1, Origin 2, Severity 2, Number 63
   ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.
   ASE1502: Query or command timeout detected, command/batch cancelled
   ASE1502: The client connection has detected this 1 time(s).


   You can also set an integer variable "max_timeout". When the number of timeouts exceeds the threshold
   specified by max_timeout, then sqsh will be aborted:

   ASE1502.sa.tix.1> \set max_timeout=2
   ASE1502.sa.tix.1> !!
   ASE1502.sa.tix.1> select count(*) from E_TIX
   ASE1502.sa.tix.2> go
   Open Client Message
   Layer 1, Origin 2, Severity 2, Number 63
   ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.
   ASE1502: Query or command timeout detected, session aborted
   ASE1502: The client connection has detected this 2 time(s).
   ASE1502: Aborting on max_timeout limit 2
   Open Client Message
   Layer 2, Origin 1, Severity 1, Number 31
   cs_ctx_drop: cslib user api layer: external error: The context structure cannot be dropped
                because the application has not exited from ct.


6) A couple of sqsh variables specifying a filename or directory are now properly expanded so you can
   use environment variables in their definition in the sqshrc file.
   The variables are: keyword_file, readline_history, tmp_dir and interfaces
   For example, when in your sqshrc file the following lines occur:
   \set readline_histsize=150
   \set readline_history='$HOME/.sqsh/sqshread_$DSQUERY'
   then sqsh will create a new readline history file for each server you connect to using "sqsh -S..."
   and will reuse that file the next time you start sqsh and you can still retrieve lines entered
   from a previous session, or search backwards using the readline ^R feature (in emacs mode), etc.

7) Advanced Network authentication support
   In version 2.1.5 experimental Kerberos support was added using the -K and -R options. -K was merely a switch
   to set Kerberos on. In sqsh 2.1.6 a more advanced implementation of network authentication is introduced,
   although still experimental.
   By using the parameters -K, -R, -V, -Z you can make use of your defined network security settings. (libtcl.cfg).
   The named options are identical to the ones defined for isql.
   -K keytab_file name for DCE
   -R server principal name when Servername specified in interfaces differs from the real servername
   -V specify security options to use (cimorq)
   -Z requested security mechanism name defined for Kerberos, DCE or PAM in your libtcl.cfg file.
   (So, the original -K option in 2.1.5 now specifies a keytab file for DCE in 2.1.6)
   For example, connecting to a remote server using Kerberos (which happens to be the default, i.e. first entry
   in libtcl.cfg [SECURITY] tab in this example):

   ~> sqsh -SLINUX1502 -Uuser1 -RFC6A1502 -Z
   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services();
   ----------------  -----------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   FC6A1502          kerberos     unifiedlogin mutualauth integrity confidentiality detectreplay detectseq

   See chapter 16 "External Authentication" from the Sybase System Administration Guide volume 1 for more
   information.

   [user1@linux-fc6a ~]$ sqsh -SFC6A1502 -Uuser1 -Zcsfkrb5
   Open Client Message
   Layer 7, Origin 9, Severity 5, Number 1
   ct_connect(): security service layer: internal security control layer error:
                 Security service provider internal error -1765328352 occurred.
   [user1@user1-fc6a ~]$ kinit
   Password for user1@LOCALDOMAIN:
   [user1@user1-fc6a ~]$ sqsh -SFC6A1502 -Uuser1 -Zcsfkrb5
   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> select program_name from sysprocesses where spid=@@spid;
   program_name
   ------------------------------
   sqsh-2.1.6

  (1 row affected)

   Note that you can specify -V and or -Z without having to specify a value. Is the value empty for -Z
   or contains the value 'default' then the default will be used, which is the first active security driver
   in the libtcl.cfg file.
   When the connection succeeds, sqsh will store the real name of the security mechanism in the variable
   secmech. For example: "\echo $secmech" may show csfkrb5. The option -V takes a list of characters from the
   possible values of 'cimorq'. If you do not want to set a security service protocol then you have to specify
   -Vx for example. 'x' is not an existing option related to a security service and as a value is provided,
   sqsh will not fall back to the default of all options. When -V is empty however, then all possibly supported
   security protocols for the selected secmech will be enabled. The key letters are:

   c -   Enable data confidentiality service
   i -   Enable data integrity service
   m -   Enable mutual authentication for connection establishment
   o -   Enable data origin stamping service
   q -   Enable out-of-sequence detection
   r -   Enable data replay detection

   If you specify -V and/or -Z, sqsh will assume network authentication is tried and no password is required.
   If you have a network authenticated connection and want to \reconnect using normal ASE authentication with
   username and password, you have to reset the network authentication variables by specifying -Znone

   For example:
   [user1@linux-fc6a ~]$ sqsh -SFC6A1502 -Uuser1 -Z
   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> \echo $secmech
   csfkrb5
   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> \reconnect -SASE1502 -Usa -P
   Open Client Message
   Layer 7, Origin 9, Severity 5, Number 8
   ct_connect(): security service layer: internal security control layer error:
   Consistency checks performed on the credential failed (minor status 0).
   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> \reconnect -SASE1502 -Usa -P -Znone
   ASE1502.sa.master.1>

   The first \reconnect fails because sqsh still wants to try network authentication. However, no user principal
   for 'sa' exists or no ticket is set and the connection fails. The second \reconnect succeeds as the -Znone
   reset appropriate variables.

Variables and the sqshrc file:

There are a couple of new environment variables defined, which can be set in the sqshrc file or on
the fly on the command line using the \set command, although changing a value will actually take effect during
a reconnect. Only histunique and ignoreeof can be activated or deactivated immediately.

Variable name    Default value  Command line equivalent

appname          sqsh-2.1.6     -N (introduced in 2.1.5)

The default value for appname is set to sqsh-2.1.6 so you can distinguish from users using an older version
of sqsh. (See also one of the previous examples where we selected the program_name from sysprocesses.
In previous version of sqsh you could set the TDS version using the -V parameter. This parameter is now being
used for Network Authentication. You can now use parameter -G to set the TDS version.
