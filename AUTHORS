Sqsh was originally written by Scott C. Gray. Scott did all the work through
release 2.1.

Sqsh is currently maintained by Michael Peppler (mpeppler@peppler.org) 
with the principal aim to keep sqsh's features and behavior in sync with
Sybase's capabilities as new features are added to ASE.

Sqsh is also maintained by Martin Wesdorp (mwesdorp@users.sourceforge.net)
Releases 2.1.6 up to 2.5 includes a lot of code contributions and bug fixes
by Martin like color prompts, better kerberos support, better timeout handling,
etc. For each of these versions there is a CHANGE description in the doc
directory available.
